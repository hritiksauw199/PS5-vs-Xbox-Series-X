0,Khang Ngo,2022,5,"This console is an absolute beast! I finally managed to get my hands on it through Amazon’s invite after 2 years of the chip shortage and scalping issues. It arrived a couple days later as scheduled, no problems. Set up was simple and was kinda surprised by the weight of the console. It’s a THICC BOI for sure. The login process took less than 10 min, quick and easy. Installed  games then instantly felt the difference. Loading times is literally insane, first time experiencing an SSD as fast as this. Unfortunately, I have a ton of big titles so the 1 TB of storage filled up shortly after. I later decided to get the Seagate expansion card which was $20 off on sale. The card is a great accessory to complement the console, I use it to store the Optimized Series X games and then a 4 TB hard drive for the older games. I also really enjoy the controller, it feels really good in the hands. Playing Overwatch 2 and MW2 at 120 FPS on my 4K HDR TV was an absolute experience! Game-pass is also great to add to the experience, great value with a large library of games with diverse genres. Overall, the console is great! Playing games has never been better for a competitive gamer like me. Sometimes I feel like I’m cheating with how powerful this thing is for only $500. However, I do wish there were more exclusives for the Series X but I feel like this console will get better as time goes on. Microsoft and the Xbox team outdid themselves in delivering such a beast of a console for this next generation. Whichever side of the console war you’re on, at the end of the day it’s a preference. I really feel like that not one side of the fandom will regret in getting any of these new consoles (Series X/PS5)."
1,SuperginraiX,2020,4,"So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box?  Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.You open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest.  It was great!  I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console.  So good job on that!I'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade.  I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it!  I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.And here it is.Visually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S.  There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before.  Everything is less fuzzy.  So that's good.  It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES.  Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2.  But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One.  The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me.  I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.And that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games.  While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility).  With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.Well... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so.  I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice.  And it isn't even the best part of the Series X.  That would be the load times.  With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast.  I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done.  This thing zips along.  That also applies while you're in the game.  Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly.  There's a lot of power in this rectangular box.  The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.It's a lot of the ""under-the-hood"" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One.  The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives.  I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now.  If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service.  I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.And, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass.  You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X.  It's a good deal.I'm happy with my purchase.  I wish Halo would have made launch.  I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing.  But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable.  In the end, it comes down to where your friends are.  Mine are on Xbox so here I am.  This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.But if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season.  Miles Morales looks really good.But if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform.  You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get.  In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.Oh! This thing also has a controller!  It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller.  This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version.  There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch.  So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now!  I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.Anyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware.  This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time.  Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.But, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)"
2,Ricardo Orrantia Ponce,2021,5,"I have been a gammer all my life, have owned almost every console since the Atari Pong all the way till the Ps4 and Switch, but I have skipped most Xbox' s except for the original that was given to me as a gift.This new console that Microsoft has made is in my opinion the absolute best in this generation. Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.So how can't  you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.Yes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.PROS:- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).- Intuitive and very functional OS.- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.- FPS Boos feature for older games.- Automatic HDR for older games.- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.- More available space in internal drive then PS5.CONS:- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.SPECS:- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)- Graphics: AMD Navi/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)- Die Size: 360.45 mm2- Process: 7nm Enhanced- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320mb bus- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD- I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mmFinally, I will recommend  this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.The Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.PRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.Great job Microsoft, you not only added a customer, but a new fan."
3,Anthony C. Franchino,2022,5,"When I purchased this, I was afraid of the internet scams going on these days, open a box and see an empty shell. This is legit and it’s at retail price which you can’t find on eBay or other online buying sites. It’s perfect. Exactly what I purchased.It’s also a gaming console so it does everything it needs to do just like my Xbox One X. No complaints."
4,Jesse,2021,5,"I started out on the OG Xbox when I was 5 years old cause my dad bought it, he then bought the 360 and I loved that. When PS4 came out however I bought that cause the og Xbone was trash. After a 4 years or so however I had a spat with Sony customer support which if you have dealt with them ever it's awful. Pre-ordered a bunch of games, but then decided to stop gaming  in college (stupid decision), they wouldn't let me cancel despite then being pre-orders cause they're policy is trash. I disputed it, they banned account, I created a new one later on my roommate's PS5. Really liked horizon forbidden west not gonna lie. Nothing was actually seriously wrong with the PS4 itself, just Sony was. Xbox one x came out and I just had to buy it. My dad had the og Xbox one, and my word the continual updates to Xbox UI showed, it was fantastic. Then the game pass came out, if you are a playstation camper, let me just say this thing is actually amazing. I'd been falling out of love with gaming honestly, all the AAA games coming out had sucked recently. It felt that I couldn't have fun without spending a lot of money. One of the first games I played on the game pass was Control. Holy crap I missed out on this when it launched, and  I never would have discovered it if not for gamepass. I've discovered over 20+ games I never would have bought at full price and am loving it, it made me like gaming again truly.  When PS4 and XSX we're announced it felt like PS5 was the Xbox one at launch all over again. Trying take as much money as possible, and not being consumer friendly. Xbox smart delivery (no rebuying games) compared to Sony's pay $10-$20 for upgrade or buy the PS5 version for $60-70 all over again. Like come on, that's BS. All my saves are saved in cloud, I set up my XSX in 10 min, 7 of those was because it was updating. Only thing I had to do was download my games. Yeah launch titles sucked, but Xbox bought Bethesda so that doesnt matter anymore. All first party games are on the game pass day 1. I have not bought a single game since I bought control's XSX version (I could still play Xbox one version on game pass but I wanted to give Ray tracing a go, I had not purchased the Xbox one version though I should note, so this was my first time buying at a gp discount no less). It's fantastic, I'm getting equal or better value than PC (since new games are released on it as well). Everything is just so easy and simple on Xbox compared to PS5. It's like IOS vs the early days of Android (which I now own). Having experienced PS and Xbox, Xbox just has a much more stream lined experience. Also Xbox live crashes like maybe 1/6th (honestly maybe less) of the amount of PSN, like good lord that was actually the most annoying thing ever. The PS5 itself just seems outdated, and Sony seems hostile to the consumer.  Honestly this is hands down the best console I have ever owned except maybe the 360 because that was gaming's last golden age imo with COD, halo, GOW, mass effect, too many to name. Overall a just superior product, I do hate Sony after my spat, I fully admit that, but objectively this console is just better. I see nothing but frustration on the PS5. I will miss Horizon, but that's it. So unless you absolutely need God of war or something, like what Halo is (was) to me, buy this. Hell buy this over a PC, I was debating it, but this year and probably next year as well is just bad for getting or building a gaming PC. Seriously buy this console if you are on the fence, if you are debating at all, buy this console. It's xbox's generation this time around, for value, ease of use, as a finished product, and #1...for games and gamers. I debated for weeks which console to buy last generation, but it was simple this time around and I have zero regrets. In the end for the same amount of money you will be able play 2-3x the game you would on PS5, you can play 360 and OG Xbox games as well, for free if you own them already. If you own a gaming PC though, you don't need it."
5,Brillis,2022,5,"+Powerful hardware that can keep up with some PC's.+Game Pass library is great!+Beautiful graphics and visuals.+No technical issues out of the box.+Also plays BluRay, DVD and CD's.-I'd like to see Game Pass increase the quantity of available games.-Large downloads (Both system and game) can make things tedious for users with slow internet speeds.Overall, great console that I'm thoroughly enjoying"
6,Jamie,2022,5,I had searched everywhere to get this for my son for Christmas. Nobody had it. I was so happy to find this on Amazon and at the best price I have seen. Shipping was so quick and it arrived undamaged. My son was so happy Christmas morning!!
7,Rodney Peterson,2020,5,"Back in 2013, both Microsoft and Sony launched the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (respectively). Compared to the generation prior (Xbox 360 and PS3) and how those compared to current PC's of the day, the seventh console generation did not start well. From false promises from Mark Cerny about the PS4 hitting 1080p and 60FPS for every game, to Microsoft's loss of focus on gaming... couple that with the less than impressive comparison to PC's, and you would find the apology for sale a few years later with the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. Those were what we should have gotten to kick of a generation.Now here we are in 2020. The only downside has been acquiring one of the consoles and the lack of supply due to COVID-19. The Xbox Series X (seriously, Microsoft needs to do something about the naming) is a great offering with great value tucked away inside of the Xbox service.Without getting deep into the technical specs, I will highlight some key differences between the Series X and the One X. The SSD is first. Fast load times across the board for games and the system itself. The 1TB is not what you get in full, but it is not an issue if you keep a small catalogue of installed games. Currently with 6 games installed (AC: Valhalla, Destiny 2 ((all expansions)), GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Watch Dogs Legion), i am sitting at 357.5GB of free space. The frame rates are great with the ability to keep a steady 60FPS and achieve up to 120FPS. 4K is glorious with HDR. The Ray Tracing that some games have is a really nice touch, but unless you stop to smell the roses (or in this case the, wander up and stare at them), it doesn't jump out at you.Otherwise the console is impressive. Not a single sound has come from the machine in my few hours (extended this evening) of play time. The start up speed is incredibly fast and this is both from a fresh boot, to the low-power mode, to the unplugging method. Quick Resume is something to appreciate as well. Being able to have a handful of games running at once is a nice feature especially if you are one who has game ADD, or want to hop back into a single-player game after having a multiplayer session with friends.The new controller is built on the old saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" While Sony went with a new design and functionality for the PS5 with the DuelSense controller (seriously the haptic feedback is a cool addition, but I have a weird feeling it will fade out at some point), I can't help but feel Microsoft kinda missed a chance with the Series X controller, by not adding a similar feature. However, the controller feels lighter than the last, that could be due to the fact I am using batteries instead of a play and charge kit. It feels also, slightly slimmer all around, but the shape is still ergonomically pleasing for any hand to hold. I don't mind the absence of an internal battery pack. I find that the play and charge is a nice option, and that with batteries you never have to worry about being plugged in. The jump to USB type C is nice as well, as most of the devices I own use that port exclusively. Added on to the controller's body is a texture around the back of the hand grips and the tops of the triggers. My grip feels more stable and connected. Also, the addition of a share button is nice for two reasons. First it is a great way to capture what you want without sacrificing gameplay or being vulnerable in a multiplayer title. And 2, it allows for screenshots to now be captured that when being taken by hitting the Guide button, would sometimes cause elements to disappear.As for the value tucked away that I mentioned, that comes thanks to Game Pass. A service I was not fully sold on when it was announced, but as time went on, I became interested and am now a member. And now with them (Microsoft) partnering with EA to bring EA Access to game pass, it makes me wonder what the future holds."
8,SIILKK G.Q,2023,3,"I love Xbox X but the memory is totally disappointing. I don't want to spend $200 -$400 to install the games I frequently play on an expansion cards sold only by one supplier. You can only play XS games on internal or the Seagate card. As more of the games on my external hard drive update to XS they become useless as I have no room on the internal hard drive.  PS5 allows you to pick your own compatible ssd drive from various suppliers making them affordable. PS5 also allows you to pick ps5 or ps4 versions of the game allowing compatibility with what ever hard drive you have. Xbox forces you to update your game to XS if you are using the XS....thus making your game on external hard disk useless. Xbox please stop making dumb decisions and make the system as compatible and versatile as possible. With halo dead and gears of War dying Xbox needs to step things up. I left PS because the network WAS terrible always down, matchmaking at the time WAS none existent, then they got hacked, ruining all online play for half a year and my credit card info was sold on the black market. I remember when Xbox gold games was A list games not F or D list games, and you owned them.  I have not forgotten, but if you don't tighten up I'll leave you too. But other than my personal rant and no choice but to by high price memory, the system works. Pushes 120 frames and 4k with games that allows the settings. Hate that they removed the hdmi one guide input, like in the Xbox one cause I used that as my cable box and gaming all in one."
9,Austin Berry,2022,5,Had this for 3 months or more and I’ve been impressed with what it can do compared to the original Xbox x that I have.Definitely happy with my purchase!
10,fred alvin waitkuweit,2022,5,"When I first open the box presentation was spot on beautiful definitely keeping the box 🥹 best gift I could get myself this year!!!!!!If you worked hard this year and not able to get yourself a PS5 and play a lot of sports games like me then this console is a must get!!!! Xbox has a great library of exclusive halo, gears of war, knights of the old republic just to name a few titles 😏 either way for me this was perfect!!!!!! Merry  Christmas to all !!!!!"
11,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"Got the invite maybe within a week. Had to buy it and it came fast! All you scalpers are losing! It’s a must have for anyone with the xbox one, upgrade!"
12,Angel Lara,2022,5,"Lo mejor que me he comprado en la vida, puedo jugar a 4k 60 fps sin problemas, el gamepass está brutal, 1000% recomendado."
13,Walter Howard,2023,5,"Great delivery, great item."
14,Brenda Moore,2023,5,Received in perfect condition on delivery date promised.
15,Jason,2023,5,I like everything and dislike nothing.

17,TJ52,2022,5,"It’s dope, new controller is dope, but not rechargeable so that’s an L"
18,Michael,2022,5,Very easy to setup. We live all the features and easy Internet access
19,Amery Gallegos,2022,5,"Been working since June, no complications what so ever. If ur worried about purchasing from Amazon due to refurbished game consoles, I highly recommend purchasing here. I have no regrets :)"
20,Thomas MacDonald,2022,5,Finally got the invitation for new xbox series x. Load times are so much  better and zero video lag I can see.
21,Mihalis in Kansas,2022,4,"The Xbox Series X is phenomenal. The display is beautiful and it has a terabyte of storage. That being said, know that if you plan to use this for VR purposes, it is NOT capable of doing so. The PS5 is definitely able to handle VR, and renders an on par quality as the XBox Series X. To be honest, the PS5 operates much quieter as well with the fan being almost indiscernible while playing games or streaming. If you are looking for a machine that will handle VR, (Virtual Reality), the Xbox Series X is not an option. I sent mine back in favor of a PS5."
22,Colleen Quirk,2022,5,"Ordered Monday, received Wednesday morning.  Was exactly as advertised and works perfectly."
23,Anonymous MB,2022,5,Xbox came as described - description said 2 controllers from seller. Gave extra game. Some small scratches. Otherwise perfect.
24,Austin Red,2022,5,"I had doubts about getting the upgraded console, but I see that doubt was misplaced. The console is amazing! No issues with disconnecting, no frame drop, amazing graphics! I'm glad I upgraded!"
25,Scott M,2022,5,"I haven't found anything bad to say about this XBOX yet. And I can't put my controller down...maybe that's the bad thing!Graphics are unreal, load times are really fast...I love it!"
26,Reid Frederiksen,2022,5,"Came Brand new, perfect condition."
27,Joe,2022,5,"Glad Amazon implemented an invite program for purchasing. I was waiting to buy the Series X when the prices came down to at least MSRP. Backwards Compatible gaming is great. Most will play, but check the list to confirm."
28,Briar Cockrell,2023,3,"Below is my angry rant about wanting to play games I already have. Overall, I'm very happy with the Xbox I received. It's got amazing graphics and some awesome processing powers. I'm still frustrated that I can't use it with the games I wanted to play, but that's something I'll have to live with. I like playing on this console, but if there could be a way to link my accounts and transfer games over, that'd be appreciated.(Previous review) I'm livid. Literally bought my first TV for my apartment, 4K, and this new Xbox Series X so that I could play my favorite games on a couch in my living room. This is my first console, first TV, etc. I already own several games that I've paid for. Guess what, YOU CAN'T INSTALL THEM EVEN AFTER LINKING ACCOUNTS. That should be enough to tell your systems that I OWN THOSE GAMES ALREADY. But no, you'd rather I still pay $70 each because of capitalism.The majority of the games I wanted to play aren't included with the Game Pass either, so I don't suggest that. If you wanted to play your games across multiple platforms, this is NOT FOR YOU."
29,*~AJ~*,2022,5,All good. Competitive price. Nice they prevent people from hoarding and reselling at stupid markups.
30,Juan morles,2022,5,"Está excelente, me gusta su diseño y desempeño. Los juego se ven 10/10"
31,David Smerza,2022,5,Just wish I did not have to buy a fan to help with cooling.
32,Simon,2022,5,Product came with clean packaging. New!
33,Rolando Bravo,2022,5,Gracias por la invitación
34,Amazon Customer,2022,4,"I just got the Xbox Series X. I gave it 4 stars because I really liked my xbox one kinect. It came with voice command and of course the camera you could use to interact with games. I didn't grow up playing video games, I got hooked in my early 20s. I am an old lady of 61 so I've played on a lot of platforms/systems. So the new games are moving on and to keep up I have to buy the newer game systems. And I have to say on this xbox series x I LOVE THE PICTURE/GRAPHICS QUALITY, LOVE THE MEMORY/STORAGE SPACE. It deserves 5 stars but change is hard and money's tight."
35,Amazon Customer,2022,5,I got an invitation to buy the new console.  I was going to buy a 4K blue ray player anyway so I decided to get myself an early Christmas present and bought this console.  This is the first gaming console I've ever bought so now I'll need to buy a game like Halo since I own no games. Guess It will play movies as well. Will be hooking it up tomorrow so will update review as I get to learn more about being a first time console owner.
36,jeremy,2022,5,Good Product
37,Vishrut S.,2022,5,"For me the jump to next level performance was higher than most because my last xbox before this one was the original stock xbox one (2013) model-halo edition. So when I bought the Series X, I could not believe it took less than 5 seconds for me to load up new saves or screens on my favorite game (skyrim); before it took several minutes. The description of a ""console that swallowed a lambo"" is perfect for this beast of a machine.Pros:1.) Extremely fast2.) Xbox Game Pass is a great service when paired with this3.) The disc option is ideal since it allows me to play old xbox one and 360 games.4.) Higher stock storage capacity than the PS55.) Design/Looks of the console may be simplistic but it fits well in any home-entertainment setup.Cons:1.) Lack of exclusives- Microsoft buying Bethesda and Activision-Blizzard makes up for the lack of notable third-party exclusives since launch in 2020; hopefully this will be fixed soon with the launch of Starfield, Elder Scrolls 6, and other notable upcoming titles.2.) The controller is only slightly updated in relation to the Xbox One controller (compared to the advances made by the PS5 controller)."
38,Lucho S,2022,4,"Amazing buy, couldn’t resist! A bit overpriced. Only wish it was a little smaller in size. Great game selection. Not bad for its value!"
39,Hector R.,2022,4,"Happy i finally got invited to purchase my Xboxs, only downfall is they don't offer insurance/warranty like you would if purchased at a store."
40,Nick Hammond,2022,5,Best console out there!
41,Justin Gibson,2022,4,It works great most of the time and is a huge upgrade from the original Xbox one but sometimes you can’t access Microsoft store and games have refused to finish downloading even months after getting it. Definitely has room for improvement in the future.
42,Kassi Tews,2022,5,"I was a littler nervous to purchase this and have it delivered (was worried someone was steal it from my porch) but it was great! Got it within 2 days and  it's in excellent condition. No damage from being delivered, definitely recommend being added to the invite list."
43,JasPlun,2022,5,"I now own both the Series X and the PS5 so I will simply say this about the Series X. It is very well built and the design has silent fans and the console heat is channeled through the top making it efficient. What I like is it is not as big as the PS5. The controller feels great. Software design is really good and the system is fast! Smart delivery makes sure you have the best version of game automatically and Gamepass is awesome. What I do not like about it is that it basically feels like the Xbox One X on steroids. The UI is basically the same so it does not have that brand new console feel to it you get with new stuff. All the games have run phenominal. If I had to choose only one console I would pick this Series X over my PS5. The PS5 is HUGE and really ugly in person. Sticks out like a sore thumb, but it performs as well as the series x and better on some games I have noticed. The new controller with the PS5 is really good and with the new UI it really feels like a new console. Both systems are great and well worth the purchase. My advice do not be a fanboy whichever console you find 1st get it you will be happy with it:P Or you can buy both like me if your lucky enough to find them both:P"
44,Theboss1,2022,5,"Huge improvement over my one x I actually ended up selling it. This console was very easy to setup out of the box in comparison to the PS5 ( own both). Both consoles are great, I prefer the Xbox controller and like the new design and triggers PS5 controller is just a bit too heavy and I don't prefer the microphone on the controller built in. Xbox is my preferred console, however the PS5 offers a huge amount of free games since I've owned it and they are all very expensive games to buy for the Xbox (grateful I don't need to) Xbox makes up for this with there ""game pass"" but in my opinion the games are not good at all in comparison to what Playstation actually gives you not lets you ""rent"" also the low fee will increase so the people that have game pass will regret it in the long run. Overall happy with the purchase, love the new Halo I only play multi-player and it's actually free wow! I would get xbox live gold card on Amazon its $55 for a year best value, I would skip the game pass that is my opinion especially since I have PS5 free games a huge amount in the two years of ownership. I honestly would buy both consoles if you can afford it with both memberships ( PSN, Xbox Live). Both consoles are backwards compatible and you keep your games how awesome !"
45,Tony Moreno,2022,5,So much faster ! I would have liked to see more package protection.  My friend bought one and it was destroyed before he was even able to open it . I'm luck it was not the case for me .
46,Scott Das Dichter,2022,4,"The console works quite well, but it does not state that you must install games on the internal storage in order to play the Series X compatible games. If installed on an external hard drive or the new storage devices only for Series X, they are specifically for storage only.  In order to play an installed game, you must move it into the internal hard drive. Another thing is you must give the console physical space, otherwise, it will overheat quite easily."
47,Skylark,2022,5,"Oh. My. Gosh! This Xbox is faster than I expected it to be, being slightly more inclined to PC gaming for the speed the SSD has over my Xbox One X. This blows my PC rig away.So far my favorite thing is that I can host my hubby from his computer on to my game on my new Xbox Series X, and he gets to experience the same load times I do. The first game I turned on was Minecraft Dungeons to play with my kids, and my loading time went from around a minute per load to a count of six TOPS.I was thrilled to see my TV recommend 4K UHD as a display setting, and have been blown away by the quality of the graphics. The controller is comfortable, and noticeably more responsive than my custom Xbox One controller, and my One controllers all easily paired with the Xbox X so I could couch coop with my family without shelling out hundreds on new controllers.It was definitely worth the money spent if you love a seamless gaming experience. I used to launch a game and then go make a cup of coffee, now I launch a game and nearly instantly play it. I'm excited to try my entire arsenal of games on this rig!"
48,Rob Hardison,2022,5,"Let just say the fiasco that was the launch of Xbox series X and all the scalpers definitely left a lot of people soured on the idea of buying one, let alone at MSRP. Amazon tried their own version of the ps5 lottery with the Xbox series X and I was lucky enough to get selected TWICE! First time I missed out because I was on the road and lost track of time, however the second time within days of missing the first I was able to complete my purchase and was delivered exactly what I ordered from Amazon without fear of getting a box of rocks! Thank you Amazon for doing it right, even if it did take a couple years to actually do it right. Now to the series X, this replaced an Xbox one X that was in perfect condition but the series X just runs circles around it with far more processing power and the faster drive speed. Apps and games load much faster and although it lost the hdmi pass through and the ability to control audio devices like it did before (lack of IR Blaster and wonky CEC controls) it’s a trade off that I was willing to make for the improved performance in other areas."
49,nathan lee tice,2022,4,I am mainly p!$$Ed because they succeeded in bambozing me into buying the Xbox one x as if it was gonna be the series x only to come out with the series x so fast. I would of just waited. But that's on me. I love the series x though. The graphics are awesome and the game pass is the icing on the cake.
50,Stacey Terry,2022,5,Bought it for my son he loves it
51,kamal main,2022,5,He plays it all day
52,Jacob,2022,5,"I was already used to the interface but the Series X makes my old One S look like a joke! It is so fast when loading menus, games, basically everything! Gaming in 4K is good too! Forza Horizon 5 looks fantastic! I look forward to trying Halo Infinite! I'm well satisfied with the performance. The console is smaller than expected. It was easy to hook up and get started. I will buy an expansion card eventually. 1TB storage is kinda weak but they gotta keep costs down I guess... Still love that expansion option! I love the controller. Sticking with the tried and true but added a screenshot button. Which I will use! So pretty cool!Overall I'm very impressed and glad I upgraded. It was pretty easy to get too. Minimal waiting on the invite.I do recommend and I would def buy again! 👍"
53,Jacob Stein,2022,5,This was my dream console
54,Victor Lopez,2022,5,"Before purchasing this Xbox, I was rocking with an old Xbox One S that I had owned for a couple of years and boy do I regret holding off from buying the series X for so long!The graphics and processing power is a night and day difference compared to my old Xbox One S. My only regret is not purchasing this a lot sooner than I did."
55,Kim N.,2022,5,"This product was well packaged and sealed with tape that stated, “Do Not Accept If This Seal Is Broken.” And, of course, it wasn’t. I read the seller reviews and was really impressed with this one. It arrived early and was delivered with care! Thank you!!"
56,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"I got an Xbox Series S earlier and I was already very happy with it, however, I had the chance to get a series X later and I will say, the extra storage alone and disc drive makes it worth it, not even talking about the 4k visuals. Add in gamepass and you have a hell of a deal on an amazing console"
57,Ryan ,2022,5,"I got this as a present for my dad and he absolutely loved it. It worked great, despite being used and all of his downloaded games on his Xbox One transferred very well."
58,Joseph Mino,2022,5,I was so excited to get a invitation to buy the Xbox x. I was a little nervous because of all the scams going on but it was fulfilled by Microsoft. The system is amazing. Way better than PS5 just saying!
59,Ariana,2022,5,Worth the money 10/10
60,M. Stegeman,2022,5,"I've been a Playstation person from the release of the original, and I even dabbled into the first 2 Xboxes. I gave up on the Xbox after burning through 3 360's due to the red ring of death.But, I wanted the Series X to balance out my TV stand! And I have poor impulse control!So far, I've been rather enamored with this big bulky black box (alliteration win). The game pass is something that is definitely worth while. I'm not going to lie, I have not bought a single game yet, and have just downloaded a bunch of games with Gamepass.The only thing that I really dislike about this device is the UI, and the fact that the Blu-ray software is not pre-installed.Now, with my PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X all connected to my TV, I can load three different Blu-rays which is great if I am watching a series on Blu-ray (For example, my copy of Steins Gate that showed up a few days back)Great device so far."
61,Tyler vitmus,2022,4,Not much to say waited 10 days for an email then it arrived promptly in one piece
62,Justin Pham,2022,5,Got the invitation about a couple days later and managed to get it delivered in two days. Everything came out good out of the box and no defects were found like other reviews mentioned.
63,Ramon_c22,2022,5,"No es de extrañar que la XBOX SERIES X sea la consola más potente del mundo, pero esto lo compruebas al jugarlo, Xbox realmente ha diseñado una consola capaz de jugar varios juegos al mismo tiempo y en un buen tv se nota la fluidez y la resolución en los juegos.Una de las mejores compras que he realizado en amazon"
64,Marlon A. Diaz,2022,5,"Un producto de excelente calidad, había costado conseguir una, gracias a Amazon por la invitación na comprarla."
65,dustin  greenwood,2022,3,I have a 15 year old computer that is running off a quad core 775 old motherboard that can literally outdownload and upload this console I know that consoles are different than computers and I understand that but what bugs me is that this system is literally junk and  for the CPU chip to the ram which is 3 times better than my computer should function and run smoothly which it does not and isn't that fast at all This was the whole reason why I was scared to move to console instead of sticking with PC all they do is make consoles left and right and they're all junk and that's what they want because they want to take your money and run with it when their are alot issues ....save yourself $500 pick yourself up an old xbox one and it runs about the same a little bit tiny bit slower and and way more cheaper oh wait no it's not it's pretty much the same price which is my issueBut you can save 300 bucks for the same crap The Microsoft server has been getting worse and worse and considering the fact that I've been paying for a membership 15 years you would think they would try to do the best they can to accommodit can to a comedy and be the best which they do not care nor will ever care about Whenever I reached out to them 1 or 2 things happened one they blamed my end or 2 they blame the game or 3 which is very rare they say the systems down blah blah blah blah blah blah But then when I say oh well if you're causing me issues I want a refund for the days then I got them marked on my calendar that are having issues for those days since I pay for it and they ignore me and they do not want to lose any money because that's what it's all about money and said a helping customers customers game and have fun Again save yourself the $300 get the low xbox one even the 360 seems to be better than this console for running smoothly anyways which which still works by the way but my xbox 1 didn't work After 2 years which is what they want and then I moved up to the other xbox and same issue and now waiting for this beautiful ex to do the same which will happen probably within a year or 2 because that's what they want they want to s**** y** and take your money very bad It's like the Call of Duty's producer in the call of duty every 4 to 6 months reminds me of the same thing with the xbox they make the game so fast there's issues and bugs and they don't care they just move on and it's the same thing with these xbox as it seems
66,Jonah Foster,2022,5,"After skipping the last generation, I decided to hop back into console gaming with a Series X and let me tell you, this thing is a beast. Handles everything at 4K and quick resume is a surprisingly awesome feature."
67,Amazon Customer,2022,5,It's just good.
68,Kindle,2022,5,"An xbox fan would be glad to have this console. As a person who hasn’t played anything since the 360 I’m glad this brought back my gaming addiction. This console is massive and looks under a television.I love that it integrates backwards compatibility for select games and has a growing list of games. It had fast loading and the best graphics i’ve personally seen.I do wish there were more consoles exclusive, it’s disappointing to see the lack."
69,Payton Moyer,2022,5,"i’ve been waiting for this thing to give me an invitation! i’m so happy i got it. i’ve been on my xbox it seems like everyday. listening to music on my xbox while i do homework after school, playing games, watching movies, so on. i’m ecstatic that i have it. thank you SO much!!!"
70,Mark Gilham,2022,5,"I have owned every Xbox (multiple) that has been manufactured (I am 69 yrs old) and always had to re-download all my games (well after CD'S). I discovered games can now be copied from the old to the new using my home network. Just plug both into the same router start both up go to settings then system, backup and transfer then network transfer, allow network transfer, select your old Xbox and you will get a list of your games to select for copying to your new Xbox. Piece of cake! Sure beats downloading, especially if you have a bandwidth cap like I do.As for the Xbox X it is quite a few steps above the Xbox One. Much faster, graphics are out of this world. Of course I have a 4k tv which allows the Xbox X to display stunning graphics."
71,Brian Walen,2021,5,"This is a fantastic console, runs great and is whisper quiet. I wouldn't be the first to admit there aren't a ton of games that fully leverage the Series X's horsepower at launch, but I'm sure that'll improve over time, just as it will for the PS5.Availability is a serious problem, and Amazon is not helping by selling to scalpers and allowing scalpers to resell consoles on their platform at insane markups.Pros-- 4K120 support. Not many games leverage this yet, but games that do look outstanding.- SSD - Any games placed on the internal SSD load at PC (or very close to PC) speeds, which is incredible. Once the SSD is full, games can be stored (but not ran) from external storage. Transfers usually don't take long between external drives and the SSD, but your mileage may vary depending on the kind of external drive you have.- Compatibility - The Series X is fully backwards compatible with any Xbox one game (besides Kinect), and works with a pretty large selection of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games. Just about any accessory that worked with Xbox One will also work with Series X, no need to buy all new headsets, controllers, or much of anything.- Looks/Aesthetic - The Series X blends in super well into an entertainment center. Mine sits right at the center of the entertainment center and doesn't look all too different from something like a home theater receiver- Temps/Noise - The series X runs super quiet and has no issues with thermals. The only suggestion that I would have is don't put it in an enclosed cabinet. It intakes through the bottom of the backside of the console and outputs heat through the top, so that needs to have at least a few inches of clearance and space to intake ambient air. My entertainment center has an open front and back, and the Series X has no issues in there.Cons-- Availability - this is a little bit Microsoft, a little bit Amazon and a lot of bit scalpers (""resellers""). Please don't buy this console for more than the $499 MSRP, it encourages scalpers to snap up more supply just so they can make a buck. Supply will catch up, but it's going to take time especially given the state of the supply chain right now.- Wireless Headsets/Accessories - I'm absolutely flabbergasted that Microsoft STILL hasn't figured out how to enable any USB/wireless headset to just WORK when plugged into the series X, or allow for bluetooth pairing with the console. Instead, Xbox still relies on a proprietary wireless standard or the ridiculous port on their controller for the use of any headset that isn't a generic 3.5mm one. PlayStation and PC BOTH support this easily, plug-and-play and have for years. There's no excuse at this point."
72,Josh Z,2022,5,"Couldn't ask for more. Loads pretty fast, graphics are great. I can load multiple games at once, at least 3 according to my experience. The controller is comfortable, you can play for hours without hurting your fingers. Just waiting for the next upcoming games to continue enjoying my new xbox"
73,Bruce A Christensen,2022,5,"My item arrived in a very fast manner, well packaged, and exactly what I ordered."
74,Snakker,2022,5,"This console is excellent.Even though this generation of consoles isn’t as exciting or revolutionary as certain console generations where huge jumps are made, it must be said that these consoles represent all that learned from the past with features perfected that we may take for granted. Examples include great ease of use, a streamlined easy to understand UI, quick responsive performance, excellent online gaming and community integration and media consumption options. New is the quick resume, a huge fan and intelligent design to prevent over heating, high performance 4k and hdr and game pass.Game pass is the next innovative feature microsoft is introducing just like they helped usher in the age of netflix on the 360, now they are making their own games collection membership and it works very well with a great lineup of games.The important stuff. Games run smoothly and at high resolutions, online works flawlessly, there is a very good library of current gen and back compatible games with sales going on all the time and at least in my opinion the controller is the best gaming controller available at this time, in terms of feel, ergonomics, looks, design and ease of use. Not to mention its PC compatible out of the boxConsole itself is beefy and in my opinion looks very niceI guess the only point against is a relative lack of exclusives but that shouldn’t deter you from it."
75,Juma,2022,5,So far so good
76,Alan Guzman,2022,5,You can play games from all XBOX platforms
77,Emmanuel Dava,2022,5,Great price!
78,Ethan Ferkett,2022,5,Lots of epic gamer moments
79,Erik Okerholm,2022,5,"We had an older Xbox one and was waiting on the Series X to come out, supply chain problems, delays and 2 years later got the note I finally got a space in line and ordered right away. Much faster, smoother, better graphics, less lag. College son LOVES it. My daughter has the Series S and that's good too if you can't wait for or find an X but if you get, GET THE SERIES X!!"
80,Lindsay,2022,5,"Upgraded to this from my Xbox One X when Elden Ring came out, and the decreased load times and increased frame rate was a literal game changer. ER struggled to hit 30 fps on the OneX, but is super smooth (maybe not quite a solid 60), but it feels like a different game. Much faster to get back to the action after each inevitable death, too. Fast traveling to different graces is so fast, I don't even have time to check my phone.The multi-quick-resume function is also awesome, as I constantly have at least 3 or 4 games ""in progress"", and being able to jump quickly from one to another (especially for my kids) is super convenient.It's also MUCH quieter than the OneX, and I can't even hear the fan when I get into a resource-heavy game.The only downside is the form factor. It was easy to have my OneX and PS4 right beside each other on my current entertainment center, but I had to re-locate the PS4 and re-route the cables. I kinda knew that going into it, but didn't realize exactly how big/clunky the console itself is.Overall, hugely happy with the upgrade. There's just a bunch of quality-of-life improvements over the One X, but there'd be a massive improvement coming from a base One. So far, the ""Series X"" exclusive games haven't really wowed me, but the advantages of running Xbox One X games optimized for Series X is definitely worth it."
81,luis palacios,2022,5,Best money spent
82,Sqweee,2022,5,"Gamer of 20+ years and have always wanted to upgrade my consoles whenever possible. Solid performance of the unit.I understand the need to request an invite to purchase the console because of the chip shortage so of course availability is limited.Comparatively, the Series X has a disc tray so you can watch blu-rays.The Series S, doesn't.Keep that in mind if you have physical copies of your games."
83,Scot DeFevere,2022,5,Easy to replace my xbox one xLove the speed. Much Improved xbox series xLoading new copies of my games so nice and cleanI don’t expect as much problemsHaving fun :-)
84,SuitsD,2022,5,"I've always waited for a couple of years with new consoles to work out bugs and issues. When I got selected for the lottery I decided to jump and so glad I did. The clarity, depth and sharpness from the Xbox one x to the Xbox X is night and day. Playing IMax movies is a whole new experience. I've had all 3 of the majors from Xbox since year 1, to Playstations and Nintendos. This thing takes the medal hands down."
85,Steven B,2022,5,I’ve been playing this since I’ve taken it out the box. I got this console for the house I spend a lot of time on the road. And I love playing video games with my grandson. So one day I got tired of packing my series s up so I got on this Amazon list. I didn’t think there was gonna be much of a graphical difference between the s and x. But wen I fired the x up I was blown away by the visuals and performance very much worth every penny. Now I gotta get my grandson one.
86,Joseph Rodriguez,2022,5,What can you really write??? It’s awesome. Graphics are incredible. It’s backwards compatible so I was able to out the 360 and one in the closet. Fits on its side in my entertainment stand.
87,Susan,2022,5,Works Good… Great picture quality.
88,Moodicus Maximus,2022,5,"For two years the console has been near impossible to find. I got an email from Amazon saying that they had some in stock and we're selling them to customers. Unlike other stores or people, they did not mark up the price at all. They charged the $500 it retails for and I'm grateful for the fair price. The delivery was quick and I'm super happy with the console. I use it for gaming but it's in the living room as an entertainment console for all. Super happy with this purchase. Thanks Amazon"
89,Eddie VW,2022,5,"7 Apr 2022.(Product arrived 6 days after Prime purchase.)First, thank you Amazon for offering this to Prime members first in a effort to bypass bots that pluck these from real people and real gamers. I am a real human and gamer and actually play this console for it's intended purpose.Second, as a near daily gamer with over 400,000 gamerscore, who has been playing Xbox since 2007, this console definitely is the culminating event... thus far. Games are played smoothly with the best 4K graphics.This replaces my Xbox One X.Improvements:-The console is more quiet than my ceiling fan, so I can't even hear it.-It's cool. It vents heat well to maintain CPU peak efficiency.-Load screen time was cut by more than half. I usually load into a game before all my Co-op partners, even the host.-Lag is no longer a problem, unless it's internet related.-Set-up is extremely easy as the contents are only the console, 2 cords & a controller.The full price tag is currently well worth it for anyone who games regularly on Xbox.I checked online for a new Xbox Series X from several retailers 5x a week for a year and a half before Amazon came through. I simply ordered it and it arrived on my doorstep. Never left the house to claim a ticket or stand in line.Lastly, thank you Amazon for selling the stand-alone console and avoiding the greed of making it an $800 bundle of other junk we don't need.Gamertag: E vee dub"
90,John Justin Bradshaw,2022,5,"This is the latest and best iteration of the Xbox along with the cheaper series S.Graphics are superb, detailed and fluid. Colours are brilliant. Games which exploit native 4k resolution and HDR really do look spectacular. Gameplay is immersive and very responsive. Controllers are very familiar to existing Xbox users, will take a bit of getting used to for those new to the platform. There are loads of games, and it is backwardly compatible with existing games. The optical drive is a real plus as it allows you to use it as a home entertainment system if you have TV and movie Bluray discs, DVDs and music CDs, just hook it up to a sound system.Something which is worth noting is that it is extremely quiet in use.The reason we went for this rather than the cheaper S is the optical drive, it is also a better performer with superior specifications, though I'm not sure how noticeable that is in reality. My only criticism is the form factor which is bulky and oddly shaped, I'd much prefer the more traditional form factor.Overall a worthy upgrade to the Xbox and the game console to buy in my opinion, 5*."
91,Isaac Jaimes,2022,5,"This is definitely the next-gen, I really loved it, and I think it is even more incredible than I expected if you haven't jumped into next-gen, this should be your choice."
92,Danny,2022,5,Finally got my hands on a brand new Xbox it was just as I expected. They should’ve updated the home screen a little bit in my opinion and did some more features for next GEN but at least you can access the next GEN gameplay for game specifics
93,Coco,2022,5,Good Product
94,Maria,2020,5,"Excellent is the best word to describe this xbox series x. I been a gamer since the 1980s and this is by far the best console ever created. Lets take a look at some pros and cons and also why I think its better then ps5.ProsIts fast! When I say fast I really mean FAST. Loads games in 5 seconds flat, menu system is snappy etc.It's powerful! The few games available to try right now that are optimized for the series x look very good and you can tell the future will bring alot of good high end graphics to consoles finally!Great selection of games thru game pass. And its backwards compatible with all Xbox games from previous consoles.ConsSo far there's only 2.1. I think they could of did better with the controller.  Although I still believe xbox controller is better then the competition in layout and thumb sticks etc. the plastic just feels cheap. The better grip and dpad is nice but the overall feel is cheap. Theres a small lip at the top that gives it a unfinished feeling. Also no rechargeable battery is a bummer as well.. Ps5 controller just looks way better and more of a future look to it.2. The system is bulky and looks like a fridge or just a big black box. The insides alot of work went into to develop a closed system with good cooling and a monster fan which is quiet and I appreciate that but the design is not good.Ps5 design is definitely better.Now why do I feel the series x is better then ps5. It all comes down to a few things.1. It's a bit more powerful2. Better online game library with gamepass.3. Better mobile play options with being able to play straight on your mobile phone or laptop or pc gives the xbox an advantage.If you always been a Playstation guy and all your friends are on there I can see sticking with ps5. But if you don't care about friends and want a bit better experience with ability to play your games even on the go then xbox is the moveI know this is a long review but I feel microsoft deserved it since they did a hell of a job with this system and I highly recommend it to anyone.If your a gamer and thinking of switching from pc to a new console then this would be the one I recommend."
95,Kendall,2022,5,Finally was able to get this xbox X. Works as expected.
96,Mike,2022,4,"I have played a lot on my friend’s xbox series s and have also played on the PS5. After playing both, I decided I really liked game pass and the general operating system of the XBOX. I decided to splurge and get the series X because of the consoles power which has lived up to the hype. My only complaint is that my controller has very sticky buttons right out of the box."
97,Robert L Caldwell,2022,5,I have not had any problems so far
98,Mahel Oro,2022,5,"Works great, delivered earlier than expected overall pretty good."
99,Nick P,2022,5,"Got this xbox as a lifetime playstation fan, not only have I been impressed by the image quality and next gen console, the xbox game pass has been a welcomed addition to my gaming life, would recommend getting that as well with this device!"
100,Quinn,2022,5,"I love my Xbox. It is my favorite purchase, but it was very expensive. The loading times are very short and it looks really cool."
101,Mark R Wootten,2022,5,"The Xbox Series X is a great follow up to the Xbox One X and addresses my biggest complaint - slow loading times. This new console uses solid state storage and it makes a huge different in load times. I also appreciate the inclusion of HDMI 2.1, which allows for 120hz refresh rates on TVs that support it."
102,Kyle Cramer,2022,5,"I've been playing on my old Xbox one console for 7 years, and when I started playing on this new console, I've notice some big differences. The graphics are much better, everything is shinier with the ray tracing process. The load screens are almost non-existent, it took forever my games to load on my old console, but with this, it only takes about 3 seconds at least. The 1 TB storage space means theirs plenty of room for most of your games. I highly recommend this new video game console if you're a hard core gamer."
103,Axel Rodriguez,2022,5,Been on Xbox since the days of the red ring of death and I’ve never had an issue with it.
104,EX,2022,5,"As a owner of a PS5, and now a Series X... I must say I'm super impressed with the speed and options of the X. Definitely glad I was able to get an X!"
105,Falkinator,2022,5,"Love it.  Gamepass is a game changer.  Hooked up to a LG 77"" CX with 4K 120Hz is gaming nirvana!"
106,Landon S.,2022,5,"Although, I have only tried Star Wars Battlefront II (the original disc) it still works amazing. It is very fast. I am thrilled to find out that they have an SSD processor installed in the Xbox Series X so for PC users they know that means a lot. I game on a PC and grew up on Xbox and PlayStations. When this came out and the mad scramble for them ensued because of COVID, I couldn't get one until now. So bless Amazon for letting me purchase one of these at a reasonable market rate price."
107,Gene,2022,5,Fast in shipping it. No damage at all.
108,Billy G,2022,5,"Great, powerful system. More bang for your buck than a PS5."
109,Infectedcluster,2022,5,"I was so happy to clearly see the Xbox on my porch from the street!  When I received my first Xbox from Microsoft, I didn't even know what it was till I opened the plain box it was in.  So this was such a nice surprise to come home to.  If you have one already, you know how awesome it is to play all your old games on this new system.  Microsoft is definitly giving PS5 a run for their money with all the new features. Not to mention I feel they have way more games that take advantage of the graphical power."
110,Amazon Customer,2022,5,It got delivered on time and everything works!
111,Peter,2022,5,"I like it very much, the only problem is that it gets very hot, you need AC to keep it cool."
112,JONATHON,2022,5,"Fast delivery,  best price and availability."
113,Brandon McMillan,2022,4,"I love the xbox series x.  Games are plenty, and capabilities are endless.  But the machine tends to run hot.  Only negative I can think of."
114,Trace Burdick,2022,5,"Better picture, faster loading, HUGE storage, nearly eliminates all lag! Would absolutely recommend to old gen players."
115,Jerry Rodriguez,2022,5,
116,Chas Nagy,2022,5,"I don't know how Microsoft is able to produce such a well-made system for only $500.00  At the time of my purchase, Amazon did not have these available for immediate purchase.  I clicked the reserve button and got a notification a few days later. I bought mine and had it in just a couple of days.  I couldn't be happier!"
117,Kindle Customer,2020,5,"To start off I would consider myself not a pro gamer, but definitely not a casual. I’m some where in between hardcore & Pro gamer. I got some insight on specs etc. This review will not be about the specs because we already know it’s damn better than last gen console Xbox One X.After a terrible, terrible, terrible...... the worst preorder experience of my life. I’m not joking. This generation of consoles preorders will go down in gaming history infamy because how bad it was, especially during our pandemic. I was as excited as I ever could be to receive this item as if I was a child all over again. And to top it all off it came 9 hours earlier on release day! I call that a significant win for preorder delivery, since this is my first time preordering a console online.Now for what your really here for, the console review. Personally, I love it. Load times are significantly faster! Games look so damn good! And total backwards compatibility with this console made me cry tears of joy. A true 4k experience. Something last generation promised us that didn’t happen.Now not anything is perfect. The one huge downside is there are no new games for this system yet. Usually there will be about 5 to 10 day one (some exclusive only to console) games. This year there’s basically 0. Yes, the positive spin on this is you have a while back catalog of older games you can play on this newer system and see the graphics ramped up. But as an avid gamer I am a Little disappointed that Microsoft the back big time even during pandemic that they couldn’t even offer at least 3 day one games. Sony is the same. These consoles will not have new games coming out day 1 unfortunately. We’ll have to wait till a little more in 2021 to expect the games we really want.If you want a more in-depth review you can head right on over to my YouTube channel where you can see an extensive review on the console today at 8pm central standard time. My dad and puppy will be on. It’l is going to be hilarious and cute. My channels name is Clive Childress. Come check it out of your interested to know more.All in all though this console is stellar. And I can’t fault the company for the pandemic situations. So with all that said this is a pretty great console."
118,NegroISO,2022,4,"What can I say, it took me a year or so to land one of these babies from Amazon, but it arrived in 2 days after I ordered so there's that.It's an Xbox Series X, better a little bit that Xbox One X, not quite as amazing as one would hope.I purchased this for Developer mode and emulation, but I am enjoying GamePass on here so I can pickup a game where I left off on the PC.The added benefit is if you have multiple users (kids) in the same house and mark this as your home Xbox, everyone gets the benefit of Xbox Live Gold so that's nice.I really wish that the machines were just a bit more powerful, 4k 30fps isn't exactly groundbreaking."
119,TED B.,2022,5,I got my purchase fast and on time no damage to the Box no broken Seals Everything was all good got this for one game and one game only for now so I will not open until that game is released the Ocean the Last Hope can you say that with me?
120,Diana,2022,5,"Thanks to Amazon I was able to purchase the Xbox for a birthday.  Everytime a store around me had one in stock. It would sell out with in seconds. Was fortunate that during prime week , I was received an invitation to purchase the item  So far so good. Opened and all games from old Xbox 360 downloaded.  Should be enough data to hold many more games. Also the graphics are very realistic and games look clearer.  Highly recommend for any big gamer."
121,Dylan Mares,2022,5,"I absolutely love this console. First off, the presentation when unboxing this is by far one of the best presentations on any console I've had. In person it looks absolutely nice, pictures don't do it justice. It's a quite console and the upgrade is worth it. Graphics are magnificent, and you can tell the difference from the older consoles. The fast loading times is amaizng as well and the quick resume as well. Highly recommend for any gamer"
122,Patrick Malone,2022,5,"The system came brand new sealed in the Box, has worked perfect so far. It was the only seller that could get ot here to me same day. Thank you!"
123,kenneth B. Echols,2022,5,"This product was impossible to find Retail wise, my daughter, since Covid was able toFind mental relief being cooped up in the house for yrs, she was using the original Microsoft’s Xbox , 7-8 yrs old !I surprised her out of the blue and found aBrand new one from a distributor with a 96%Efficient rate. We have it about 3 weeks nowRunning great, I also bought her a separate4-Terabyte storage plugged in the back byUSB she was able to now have 5 Terabyte s ofStorageDownload s are lightning fastShe’s now down to 3.7 Terabytes but isExtremely Happy- Thanks all that I wanted toAccomplishI paid $135.00 more but worth every $!!!!Thanks Amazon!!!!You’re longtime client"
124,Tanner Hudson,2022,5,I purchased because I got an invite. Knowing these are hard to come by I had to get it. My wife complained so much I sold it to the gamer girl at work. I was told that’s what it means to be a responsible adult. Adult men have hobbies like fixing the house or burning limbs in the back yard not video games. This is what I’m told from my wife.
125,Steven Rauscher,2022,5,"Absolutely LOVE everything about it.  I have been out of the console gaming thing for a while (N64 was my last console before switching to PC).  It’s taking getting used to, but I love everything about it so far!  Best purchase of the year!"
126,Nehemias,2022,5,I bought it through invitation only. This console is better than expected.  Project Cars Assetto Corsa and f12020 look amazing! BLU RAY player is excellent! I am so happy I bought it. It was worth the wait!!
127,Shaun Slater,2022,5,"I was pretty skeptical when I ordered this... After all the production hiccups, shortages, and price gouging I figured it might be a scam. It definitely wasn't! I was on the list for amor a week maybe? And then they asked me to order.... And then I had a brand new Xbox a little while later. It was new in box and has worked flawlessly so far, couldn't be happier!"
128,Keith Bell,2022,4,"Great console design, fantastic graphics, game pass is a great deal,  had to buy rechargeable batteries,wish they were like Sony and had it built in the controller. Overall I can’t say it’s much better than the ps5 nor can I say ps5 is better then the series x both consoles are excellent"
129,Tiron Brown,2022,5,I’ve been an Xbox player since I was a kid so I want this when it first came out but was worried about scalpers so when I saw this for normal price I got the same feeling but I chose to trust seller and lord be hold it’s the real deal performing like it should and it was freshly new glad I bought it and thankful it wasn’t a scalper
130,Jason Nay,2022,4,"This is a good product. Runs great, no lag , downloads fast. But the thing that got me was the ""thousands of old games from four generations"" is simply not true. If it isn't in the Microsoft store you can not play it. There are some games I have that are in the store and still they say they can't play that game. Batman and Dead Rising 2 to name a couple. So if you thought you'd play ""all"" your old titles think again"
131,Jon Lacoske,2022,5,Things way better than the Xbox One.
132,James Drees,2022,5,Running my games so crisp and fast. Such an upgrade from the other Xbox consoles.
133,Brandon Fernandez,2022,5,Title is all you gotta know.
134,POWnobodyNOW,2022,5,"Even better than reviews, better than I had hoped. Doesn't feel like I'm on console but rather PC. Do not buy from scalpers wait for Amazon to do the buyer invites like I did and get you one at MSRP. It was worth the wait."
135,Kathy Gralnik,2022,5,"I have been a Xboxer since the very beginning. Must say this one truly rocks!! Loving how fast it is! I build custom PCs so I truly know speed!! Had the Xbox Series S before this one, it just was not quite right. Gave it to my brother and was stuck playing on the Switch for many months waiting for this invite thing. Well worth the wait!!!"
136,Stereopirate,2022,5,Quality of the unit is top notch. Picture and performance have lived up to expectations. My only complaint is the odd size of the unit which I ended up having to place on the floor because it would not fit on the entertainment center.
137,jody,2022,5,Perfect. Thanks amazon for your list program to combat all the price gouging. Careful shipping and delivery.
138,Kyle G,2022,5,"Still floored at the deal I got on this! Shopping online is always risky and I was half expecting to get a brick or a poster or an Xbox only available in Japan or one of the scam Xboxes somebody gutted out and swapped the parts with the Xbox one x. HOWEVER, this thing was legit. I was paranoid about it because of the price, I was worried it would brick or green screen on me and it’s still going strong. My internet sucks out here but this REaLLY is a good Xbox series x. People are still selling these things for over a grand on the internet and I got a GREAT deal on it. Thank you"
139,salvador garcia jr,2022,3,"Just got the console, it works and was packaged like a new console but it has a tiny scratch on the top. The amazon packaging box was undamaged and the xbox box itself didn't show any damage? Has me thinking if these are used consoles? Very disappointed because it took me over a year to get one.. i will keep it since everything else is working great. Just wish it didn't come with that scratch."
140,Athena,2022,5,Gift.
141,Joseph Kelly,2022,4,"Nineteen years since my first Amazon order and this is the first review I've written. I submitted my invite request never expecting to get an actual invite. Thought it was a sales gimmick, a useful ploy to somehow drum up sales. The new Xbox was delivered today. Still a satisfied customer."
142,Sawyer Williamson,2022,5,She's a beauty and works better than expected. Thanks Xbox
143,J. L. Diaz Gonzalez,2022,5,"As a PS5 & Xbox Series X owner, i barely use my PS5 anymore. The Xbox combined with gamepass keeps me busy all the time, so many games and honestly with now Microsoft in the process of buying the Call of Duty Developer I basically get on gamepass All the sport games plus Call of duty on a console that plays great and looks great. I honestly cant ask for more. Meanwhile PS5 raised the prices for games, still has no VRR  (Which helps a lot with making games run smoother) and still no Dolby atmos on games. Which, btw, they ditched Dolby Atmos to use their own version of Positional Audio because they dont want to pay for the license. I cant use Sony's proprietary sound on my Home Theater Receiver because no receiver uses that tech, so If you dont play on headphones you wont be able to enjoy positional audio like on Xbox. Honestly, I'm so disappointed with the PS5 and Im really happy I gave Xbox a chance, its the best console this gen.  Dog included in the pictures cause she's adorable! lol"
144,Richard Gagnon,2022,5,"Love it! Been playing warzone on my xbox one for the last 2+ years and it got to the point where rendering took forever, skins and camouflage wouldn't load in pregame. All that is gone now with the series x. Super happy."
145,Jacqueline Nazario,2022,5,My boys are ps fans. I on the other hand love my Xbox. After a few years I am finally an Xbox owner again.
146,Jason ,2020,5,"This is not necessarily Amazon's fault but this was the absolute worst ordering experience of all time... This whole experience was a whole lot of ups and downs but I finally got it and it's supposed to come in today... when I finally got it, I felt as if I was charlie getting the golden ticket in charlie and the chocolate factory. In total, I will make an update when my child opens the present for Christmas and if everything is in good condition. Thank you to everyone for believing in me and I hope you can get your hands on one too.UPDATE: It is now SUPPOSEDLY running late but it says it was shipped to a facility that is about an hour away from me... I will give another update tomorrow.UPDATE: I FINALLY RECEIVED THE CONSOLE AND IT LOOKS STUNNING IN THE BOX...UPDATE: Came back 4 months later and wanted to talk about the overall gameplay... Gameplay is absolutely phenomenal... gameplay loads SO MUCH FASTER than the Xbox one x and the picture quality is stunning...  the 2 downsides of this console is that, especially since I’m on spring break, I play for about 8 hours a day and it can get VERY hot and especially if you play like call of duty Warzone or black ops coldwar. sometimes it will just shut off by itself for how hot it can get and it would automatically close out your game sometimes if your console gets too hot midgame . Also, I was trying to buy this console for 2 weeks straight and it was literally the hardest thing ever and I was SO LUCKY to get it from Amazon...OVERALL, this console is absolutely amazing and I recommend it to everybody who wants to buy it but please don’t buy this from a scalper because it’s not worth it and you would be better off waiting and if your a scalper, your not a good person."
147,Mz Trisha,2022,5,Love this. Great graphics and fast load time. Highly recommended
148,Pouya,2022,5,Bought it with Affirm payment no interest!
149,K. Ramsingh,2022,5,"i waited until the series x was available at msrp before purchasing one. i am upgrading from an xbox one s , it plays all the games that runs on the one s , but usually at higher framerates and what seems to be a higher resolution in addition to the games already optimized for the series x. quick resume is a dream come through, it takes 10 seconds from pushing the xbox button on the controller to being in-game right where you left off the day before. the games that are optimized for series x do have to be on the internal hard drive to work but if you have an external drive connected the xbox will offload some non- quick resume essential  game files to the external drive to save space on the internal drive, i have a 8tb extenal drive connected to it and it works pretty great. just waiting for the xbox series x external ssd prices to drop before getting a 2tb drive."
150,Kindle Customer,2022,5,"Fast, reliable and awesome. Xbox for the win!"
151,Greg,2022,4,The box the product came in was damaged but other than that the product was in great condition
152,Kolin,2022,4,product came with wrong power cord but it was a quick fix with a razor blade to round to edges of the rubber to fit
153,Michael R Brown Jr,2022,5,"I waited over a year to buy the new Series X, but was not disappointed.  System bootup speed is night and day from the One S and quick resume rocks."
154,Dave ,2022,4,"Ordered, shipped, plug in, play. Arrived when it should & works perfect. No issues."
155,Philip,2022,5,Love it!
156,emonster,2022,5,I'm LATE to the game and this is my first console. It's awesome!
157,Hahn,2022,5,"My 360 went kaput, so I decided to go with the series x, as most know it's difficult to find. I used the Xbox store and while still waited a couple weeks, got it a few days after being invited. I will say the graphics are killer. Worth it."
158,Alex M.,2022,5,I like everything about this console; it’s 4k and many other features it has.
159,Jed ,2022,5,"It came fast, best xbox as of 2022.Love it"
160,Amazon_Dude,2022,5,Got lucky and was able to purchase via invite only. The Xbox Series X is one of the best gaming consoles ever produced. Super fast! Amazing graphics! Sleek design!
161,Dan Greif,2022,5,"I'm so glad I was invited to buy this. I took a chance not knowing but I now own this beautiful machine. Amazon delivers yet again, I've been wanting and waiting for this Xbox for over 2 years. Finally got this gemWill edit if anything changes."
162,mexmpc,2022,5,It's great and is so much faster than the xbox one.  Avengers would take 10 minutes to load.  Now it takes 20 seconds at most
163,Jake,2022,5,"Product was slightly pricier than retail, but… let’s be real, they’re not super easy to get a hold of yet. It wasn’t an exorbitant amount (35 bucks)Seller SmurfStore is a new seller, but was quite responsive to inquiries, and the item arrived well ahead of schedule. Likely due to the fact that it shipped from CA to Northern Nevada.Came in nice normal retail packaging from the factory, or it appeared so, and was inside another box so as to not sit on my porch for someone to snag based on the label.Brought it in, hooked it up, turned it on, and it worked flawlessly.Currently awaiting Elden Ring to download to it, but I would purchase from the seller again!"
164,Hi Tech Guy,2022,5,I bought this to play Forza Horizon 5 and other racing games. The performance blows away my Xbox One X. Very impressed.
165,Angel Rafael Gomez Marcuñez,2022,5,"Lo compré en Amazon con Amazon de vendedor y como lo esperaba sin problema … me llego en la fecha indicada y lo compré al costo real… el sorteo si funciona si se le pasan las 72 horas, como me pasó a mi, se puede. Postular nuevamente"
166,N8,2022,4,Alot better than the rest
167,Alex ,2022,5,Glad amazon is doing the invite to buy item. It sucks you have to wait long time but just gotta be patient it is worth the wait. came in perfect condition definitely would recommend this product to anyone.
168,G. Kelley,2022,3,"I bought this XBOX Series X specifically because GTA Online was heavily promoting a major upgrade and bonus materials only on the XBOX Series X and PS5 platforms. I figured i needed a upgrade anyway. HOWEVER, what no one is saying is that my current GTA account will not cross over to XBOX, so I would have to start over with a whole new GTA online account. Disappointment.Also, make sure when purchasing controllers you review the list of games your new controller will work with. The G920 from Logitech for example does not work with every game and does not show up in the XBOX APP's."
169,Ayasha,2022,5,My son was wanting one for a few years and I finally got one. He's extremely happy with it!
170,Amanda,2022,5,"Its a work horse of a game system everything loads so much faster and the picture quality on my 4k tv is EXCELLENT im going to get many years out of this baby it is WELL worth what you pay for it. GAMES, SHOWS, MOVIES WHATEVER ITS GREAT!"
171,Earnest Baker,2022,5,This game system is way better thought. It has amazing graphics and the load time for games are insane. I would definitely recommend this game system to anyone!!
172,Rebecca Beam,2022,5,"The system is big, like computer tower big. It has a very nice operating system. I got the disc version to play old Xbox and 360 games. Very pleased"
173,marfa08,2022,5,"I was able to buy a bunch of PS5's and XBOX's for friends at MSRP!! one of them told me to try this since id never been on the Microsoft side of things. Coupled with Gamepass, i haven't booted the PS4 in 8-9 months as of this writing and its already listed for Sale. Sony's offering of the PS5 is comparatively weak.An xbox with gamepass subscription is the ideal gaming platform IMO."
174,Stephen Cornwell,2022,5,"I absolutely love my new Xbox. It is super fast, extremely versatile, and the graphics are stellar. I couldn’t recommend this system enough."
175,B,2022,1,"Ok, so the first gaming system I ever bought new was an Atari 2600 - so I'm definitely dating myself.  Beyond that I didn't go in for the continual upgrades and updates and all the constant upsell.  I finally did break down and buy a Wii decades later and that was fun until they shut down the entire multiplayer network and basically bricked the things to sell new games.  Fast forward to 2022 and this fails at every level for delivering satisfaction and fun without the constant annoyance of money grubbing.  First of all, include 2 controllers.  It's multiplayer and you ought to make it so out of the box.  Having to go buy an additional controller just to play it new out of the box with the girlfriend was an absolute annoyance.  Second - RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES!!!!  OMF....F....G!!!!!  Include rechargeable batteries and stop destroying the environment.  This is a simple no brainer.  Include a charging pad of some sort or even USB cables and 2 rechargeable controllers.  2 days in and the batteries died.  I'm shocked in the quality and power management.  I can use my phone constantly for days on end now and a few hours play kills a set of new batteries at $3 per pair and instead I had to go spend extra on rechargeable.Biggest gripe - NONE OF THE FREE GAMES ARE FREE!!!!!  Most are demo, limited, locked down!  The advertising says hundreds of free games!  FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!  YOU MUST PAY MORE TO UNLOCK THE REST OF THE GAME!!!!  What the heck kind of scam is this?  I'm seriously thinking about just returning the whole damn thing and saying screw it.  I mean there's 49 selections for Grand Theft Auto and you must constantly buy new feature packs and updates, or even worse you must subscribe?  Heck, when I was a kid, you bought an Atari console and it came with a couple games.  If you wanted an extra game, you went and bought it.  There were no maintenance fees, updates, add-on packs that you could buy to get an unfair advantage!!!  What has this crapola come to?The game play and controller is like every other latest tech.  Buzzwords and features galore, but it is all predicated on screwing you for more money at every step.  CONSTANT IN GAME UPSELL!!!  PLAY A NEW FEATURE!!!  BUT WAIT, IT'S $9.99 TO PLAY IT!!!!  At this point I am really disgusted and I'm not going to pay to make Microsoft richer.  I'm going to put this console where it belongs inside Gates."
176,Zemier,2022,5,Always love Xbox this one is a bit on the heavy side so be careful of a mounted shelf. All in all works great. Sad it doesn't have the passthrough HDMI ports anymore. But still great.
177,Kendrick Hardin,2022,5,"Lots of reviews are complaining about the wait, etc. That said, their is a shortage on supply and many vendors are scalping these. I sent a request through Amazon and 3 weeks later I have a new Xbox Seires X.Very simple steps, slightly long turn-around.... but, hey, with the supply shortage everything of quality is taking longer to get.... and this unit is exactly what I wanted, paid for, and expected."
178,Dirt Dog,2022,5,"Dont have to wait for game to reload forever when you die, its like 3 seconds..love it.  loads so fast."
179,Marcus Robinson-Johnson,2022,5,Got my invitation to order this last month and I've enjoyed it thus far. Love that I can finally play games and watch movies in 4K using my 4K TV and the fact that I was able to get this at it's original cost and not one of those outrageous prices scalpers are charging.
180,Damien Smith,2022,5,"So excited to finally have one! This thing is amazing, especially after not playing on a system other than switch for the last year."
181,joshua bowers,2022,5,What can I say. It's an XboX series X. It came in its original box still sealed with everything it was supposed to. Enough said right?
182,alex,2022,5,"I expected my package to arrive Monday, August 22nd, but received it Thursday, the 18th. I love the promptness of the shipping and delivery. Came with everything just as described. I love it and can’t wait to do business with them again"
183,JGtz,2020,5,"I've been playing Xbox since the OG version back in the early 2000's, the 360 was a nice leap from that OG version, the One was a good evolution from the 360, and now the XSX is further refinement. There's nothing really revolutionary especially if you're coming from the Xbox One X that had a powerful GPU already.Launch game list is atrocious, nothing really great to captivate the Xbox faithful. In the month and a half that I've had this console I've played Rocket League, Cyberpunk, Ori, GOW 5, Gears Tactics - they look nice but really can't see a difference compared to my One X graphically. Of course, there's the much better load times, instant game boot up and general quitness to the console which are a great improvement but is it worth $500 over the $500 I paid 2-3 years ago for the One X? Not really.Overall, I am an early adopter of tech, I've had all the day one editions since the 360 so I am a beta tester of sorts - I do anticipate the XSX to get better starting in 2021 with more first party games takind advantage of the the strong GPU and SSD performance. But for now, if you're a casual gamer like me or have the Xbox One X I would say to hold off until mid-late 2021. If you are rocking the Xbox One or Xbox One S then this is a worthy upgrade just for the visual upgrades and speed improvements.I play on a 65"" LG CX Oled TV via HDMI 2.1 cable, hopefully in 2021 more TVs are able to take advantage of all the tech the XSX offers for cheaper."
184,Thomas Faith Jr,2022,5,"The package came fast, console works flawlessly. Very happy and highly recommend getting. The Amazon Invite is nice. Wish I would of used this system when I got my PS5."
185,Campbell,2022,5,I’ve been hesitant to ordering an Xbox because of the prices but finally agreed to their $60 adjustment. It’s brand new and everything I hoped for! Thank you!
186,Tomczak,2022,4,I own both the PS5 and The series X. TBH I like the PS5 more. The controller is just top notch. But I keep the series X in order to play with non-cross platform games with friends. The actual size of the console is better/smaller than the PS5. To get the most out of this though… you need a newer 4K UHD TV.
187,will,2022,5,"I was on the invitation order list and it took about a week or two to be eligible to buy this item. It came in without any damages and worked right out of the box. It came with a controller (not the best but gets the job done) and the HDMI cable for it's graphics. It was an easy setup, even for an old man who last used the 360."
188,B Ryan,2022,2,"I honestly don’t understand why this is in such high demand.  The only reason I don’t give the series X.1 star and gave it 2 is because it’s fast.  However the rest of it is just frustrating and annoying.First, bugs bugs and more bugs.  Half the games I pulled down from the cloud/game pass  don’t work.  Some say they’re installed but you try to launch them and it tells you you need to install it.  Lol,  I’m showing a game taking up 80+ Gig of hard drive space after waiting a day for it to pull from the cloud but the system tells me it’s not installed.  So you uninstall the game that says it can’t play cuz it’s not installed, you following?  I know, it’s confusing….The hard drive space frees up so you know it was actually there.  So I really wanna play the game, let’s try again.  Pull the game form the cloud again overnight and next day, there it is,  chewing up hard drive space, launch that bad boy and…..”you need to install this game to play it”….  Forget it, this thing is a $500 brick.  What a joke."
189,Street,2022,5,This came in 3 days after I received the email and ordered. If was shipped from Amazon so it comes fast. It was brand new fresh out of the box. Everything came in perfect condition.
190,Born,2022,5,I love it. Came on time. Works perfectly.
191,Konner McIntosh,2022,5,"Finally got my hands on one after all this time!! I’m very happy with it!! First off, and most importantly to me, it upreses all the previous games! Regular Xbox one games look INCREDIBLE!! Such high resolutions and such crisp frame rates. It has an incredible amount of games, with all of Xbox one, plenty of Xbox 360, and even some original Xbox games! Couldn’t be happier"
192,TRAVEL_JUAN,2022,5,From the time of invitation request to delivery was about three weeks. Not bad at all and only $549 shipped.
193,Brandon Zdanowski,2022,5,Couldn’t be happier ordered it Friday morning got it Saturday afternoon! It’s grind time!!
194,Alexis Medina,2022,5,Finally its happened to me! Got my xbox in place and I just can not hide it!
195,Tim Lyons,2022,5,"I've only owned it for a week, but I have been extremely happy with my Series X! It arrived 2 days early and was packaged so well I think it could have taken 2 or 3 falls from the delivery truck and been just fine. I'll definitely purchase from this seller again in the future."
196,Nicolas,2022,5,The only thing  better is a high end PC.
197,aaron,2022,5,It is a good buy... just wished hard drive was bigger.  Also I hope they do mot make a new machine for eight years.  I hear they have a new one coming out next year.  The machine hasn't even used it power yet.  No games are in 4k and Ray tracing hasn't yet been used.  Waiting.  Game pass looks good at 14 a month to have over 100 games.  Make sure you have have high speed internet.
198,Ben,2022,4,"I was really glad to get this three days ahead of when they said it would be delivered. The box was slightly damaged, but other than that it was all good. Still sealed and new. Set up was easy. Good clean crisp looking console. Jumped from PS4 to the Series X. So far it's been a good decision. Game Pass has been a blast and got first month for 1.00!"
199,Zachary K.,2022,5,"Everything about this console is 10/10 for me. Everything down to storage space, picture quality, functionality, it's all great."
200,Nathan,2021,4,"The Xbox Series X is a power house of a machine. It is amazing how much power they could fit into such a compact from factor while still keeping it both cool and quiet. It almost seems too good to be true, right? Unfortunately, you would be correct to say that. While this machine is great, it is being held back by game devs. Don't get it twisted, this has nothing to do with the developers not utilizing the full power of the Series X, because believe me, they are. Rather, it's how they utilize it and the lack of customization they give to the consumer. To make my point, I will be using two popular games as an example, being fortnite and destiny. I have chosen these two games because they each have a PVP as well as a PVE game mode. Another similarity they share is that while the PVP game mode offers a performance mode, as well as a visual mode, the PVE mode is forced to use the visual mode running at 60 fps. This does not make sense. in both games, the PVE is hardly more taxing than the PVP mode, and in the case of fortnite, it is significantly easier to run than its PVP counterpart, so why don't the developers allow us the option to choose refresh rate over visuals? As someone with a 1080p 144hz monitor, 4k is completely worthless to me, so why should I be blocked off from using the full capabilities of my display? This is not an issue of power, but laziness on the devs part. It is because of this that I sold my series x and also why I must remove a star."
201,Matthew Miceli,2022,5,"Graphics are incredible, runs insanely smooth, best Microsoft console since 360"
202,Jakob,2022,5,Good
203,Julio Mendoza,2022,5,Really glad that it came by fairly fast and in really good condition! Works completely fine as I hope to get another one for a friend eventually
204,Clinton,2022,5,"The Xbox Series X is a great console with fantastic multimedia capabilities.  I can enjoy 4K gaming, stream movies, watch YouTube, and chat with my friends when needed.  Couple that with the backwards compatibility that allows you to play Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One games and you have a combo that's nigh impossible to beat.  When the Series X launched, I KNEW it was the console for me, but I was only able to snag one now due to widespread shortages.  I wholeheartedly recommend this above the Series S, and if you find the Series X at MSRP ""BUY IT!""  At inflated prices...I say wait until you find one at MSRP."
205,Jeremy,2022,5,Title says everything. Make sure your tv is 120 fps to fully enjoy the quality. If it's not then the Series S with expandable storage may be a more cost efficient solution.
206,Tony,2022,5,"I have never used PS5 so I'm not sure how it would compare, but I love Xbox x series, from looks till performance. It works well and has great graphics. Best use of money."
207,Amanda,2022,1,"I bought a Xbox series X when it first came out from Amazon. After a year of use the system started to shut down mid game. The problem with the Xbox was a known issue with many users. Thankfully I bought this warranty from Amazon. I put in a claim and sent in the system. I received an email confirming it was received on 1/3/22 and that it takes 5 to 7 business days to repair. They said if things change they would let me know. On 1/10/22 I checked the status of my claim online and it said  there wasn’t a claim anymore. I thought it was a glitch and checked it the next morning. I received the same message. I checked my email and never received any, so I called Asurion and they stated that they could not repair it and was waiting for approval to buy it back! I was confused as to why they never contacted me. They never told me why they couldn’t fix it either. So it’s confusing how a company that claims to be experts in repairing electronics couldn’t fix a system that was mostly functioning as intended. Especially considering many other owners had this same issue repaired with no problems and back to working 100% as intended. But this very large company couldn’t perform what small repair shops could fix for others. The system would only shut down with a few games but other than that the system functioned properly with any other game. When I asked what I would be paid for the system they said the cost of the item and refused to pay back the taxes. The person said I should receive a call or email later on in the week. A few hours later I received a text stating that they will be refunding me and to wait for an email. Shortly after I received an email stating they  had refunded me by giving me an Amazon gift card for the item?! I became extremely agitated and called them. I made them aware they never updated me while they were fixing the console. I said I want a check mailed to me and not an Amazon gift card. That the item is no longer in stock and I would have to look elsewhere. Their response was that I can use the card for anything on Amazon. I became more agitated. They never gave me a choice of how I would like my refund. That is a terrible business practice! I then spoke to a manger who said he will bring it higher and see what he can do. He called me back within an hour and told me the same thing they did earlier. He stated that they do not send out checks for any items under $1000. That they do gift cards and since they have a partnership with Amazon that’s one of the reasons why they gave me a gift card. I must assume they decided to give me a gift card to Amazon as it would save them money. By their own admission they have a partnership with them. But as everyone is aware, these consoles are still regularly sold out and extremely difficult to obtain. The supervisor emailed and stated they will give me a $20 refund for my protection plan. Theysaid they would put it on my initial credit card I bought the plan and system on. I then emailed them and asked why can they give me $20 on my credit card but not the $499.99? They claimed that a gift card is a default option. This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had. I will never buy a warranty through them again! I looked up my activity in Microsoft on 1/14/22 and it showed that the Xbox was backed up which should be impossible since they said they couldn’t fix it. So somebody is using the system they claimed couldn’t be fixed. I will never buy something like that from Amazon either if they continue to use them! BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
208,Julian,2022,4,"The box was pretty beat up, definitely saw some wear and tear but other than that I'm starting it up now and will definitely see the results"
209,Christian cazares,2022,5,I love my Xbox thank you! Came right on time they handle my package with care. Xbox wasn’t defective works perfect best purchase ever! Thank you
210,John McCurdy,2022,5,It is a good idea to have a cooling system for this.
211,Manuel,2022,5,"Nunca me había comprado una Xbox pero está Xbox series x es muy buena, todo rápido, la compatibilidad muy buena y no hace nada de sonido ni se calienta.. 5/5 estrellas"
212,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"After a year and a half, I was finally able to get one. And I love it!!"
213,jesse,2022,5,Solid product. New as said!!
214,Daniel Wright lll,2022,5,I love my new Xbox loads of entertainment
215,whiskeyfoy,2020,4,"I will start by stating I know the risks of being one of the first to get new tech.  So take my review with a grain of salt.  If you are reading this 6 months from now you probably are fine.  I am giving 4 stars because I feel the early release pains are more on the company and not the product.My review is that the Xbox delivers on what it said it would.  It is crazy powerful and just runs games beautifully.... For the short amount of time it did that.  There I was, in the middle of a 10 kill Warzone Trios making sick comms, about to secure another W all while saying ""If they only knew it was on the new Xbox"" then all of a sudden... bewp... Series X Series-ly shut down out of no where.  Not just a casual bye, no, like an angry significant other coming in and saying ""You're still playing that game?!?"" and slamming the door in your face.  I tried a number of things to get the Xbox to come back to me.  I sang it a song, tucked it in, promised I would buy every Microsoft exclusive game.  But alas nothing worked.  I now have a very, plain looking, desk weight.  Now I get to go through the fun and lengthy warranty return process with good ol big brother Microsoft.  I will take solace in the few short hours I got to brag and make fun of the ""one'ers"" who couldn't get their hands on one, but will likely have a working console before I get my replacement.  C'EST LA VIE"
216,Thomas Weeks,2022,5,Best Xbox ever
217,Nicole ,2022,5,He didn’t even know it was refurbished. It runs absolutely great with no issues at all. You would never know this wasn’t “brand new.”
218,johao prada,2022,5,Llego súper bien muy rápido y funciona de maravilla
219,Eli Brady,2022,4,get a ps5 unless all your friends have xbox then I guess you should buy this
220,Robert Hopkins,2022,5,"The box came with a little damage on the corner, but the system works perfectly. No complaints."
221,Wes Marshall,2022,5,Item received in excellent condition only the controller is battery operated not charging so needs to get charger for it and recharge battery
222,Jesus Mora,2022,5,
223,James,2022,3,This product works as expected.  The box was damaged slightly when I received it.
224,Sean McNaughton,2022,5,Diehard nintendo/ps person... but Microsoft worked some black magic on this one. Worth it with gamepass 100%
225,Supa one,2022,5,A incredible gaming console only a V.R option could improve this gaming experience.
226,Vincenzo ,2022,5,My biggest concern about the product was if it was legit. Waited for delivery and when it I was instantly relieved. This was an amazing purchase for a fair price!
227,Carlos Torres,2022,5,The best gaming experience.
228,JH,2022,5,"Hittin' the 60 age mark, time to show those kids whose boss."
229,Christopher S,2022,5,"System is awesome, as I expected."
230,Ruperto Romo,2022,5,It works and plays like a dream.
231,Shril,2022,5,Just what the title says.
232,Gman,2020,5,"I only had this for a few days and so far I love the system. It sits 6 feet away from me and I can not hear it. It is so quiet. I was originally was going to get the Xbox One X in 2018 to replace my Xbox One Launch version but so glad I held off as the XSX is able to run older games nearly at the intended locked framerate with rarely any drops like the Xbox One X. I pulled out some of my old favorite Original Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox one games and they all look better with a more stable framerate, a higher resolution with higher amounts of AF.All in all the system is lighting fast. Usually, with load screens, I would pull out my phone or walk away to do something else. With this system, you really cannot do that anymore due to the lightning-fast SSD. The Xbox dashboard is very snappy like modern high-end smartphones. I am very glad I didn't get the Xbox1x and got this. The controller is similar to the Xbox One controllers but it has a textured backside. The triggers also feel more solid.Lastly, I'm not one to do game subscriptions but GamePass is very enticing at $15 per month. I'm planning to sign up by the end of the month.All in all, it's a good value if you have a 4K display. Coming from a Steam PC gamer Im very impressed with the system."
233,Riley Wittiger,2022,3,"Its in good condition, but they failed to mention the front USB port was bent out of shape, so I had to use a pair of scissors to bend it back. Luckily, it still worked."
234,William Jacocks,2022,5,Worth every bit of the 500 bucks I paid.
235,SpiritCrushes,2022,5,I have been waiting a long time to get this. It works great and the graphics are amazing! Just loving my game time.
236,Brad H,2022,5,"Great console with a lot of improvements on the social side and overall operating system. Most importantly it was sold at regular retail price of $499, I was skeptical thinking it was a scam but it was sold directly through Amazon LLC so I was very excited to see one for less than $800+ that scalpers list them for."
237,Nathan Johnson,2022,5,"I'm sure some of the reviews on here are referring to over pricing. I was able to buy one at $499.99 and it did take a week for delivery but yeah... from series s to x it a decent graphical jump and also like the series s, the X hasn't had any menu pick-ups and runs super smooth. My games that are for xbox one seem to load faster even on a hhd than they did on the series s. Very pleased. Thank you for allowing some relief from all the price gouging Amazon. Had to wait over a year to secure one of these at MSRP no matter how I tried to get it."
238,Jeffrey Lim,2022,5,Would definetly recommend if you are in the xbox ecosystem
239,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"Everything it has been advertised to be, and eerily quiet!"
240,Telee,2022,5,I have had my Xbox Series X since November 2020 and I still can't get over how fast the loading screens are while playing games vs the old Xbox One X. The Series X is such a improved console in every way and really helped me get in to gaming as a kind of therapy for my mental health issues and anxiety. The graphics are so beautiful and it's nearly impossible not to let yourself be taken in to the world and story of the game you are playing. I really hope that Microsoft figures out their supply chain problems already so everyone who wants one can get one.
241,William Chmielewski,2022,5,Excited to finally have the new Xbox and love it so far!
242,The-tx-barrs,2022,5,All I can go on is my son loves it!
243,justin,2022,3,Box was trashed but console wasnt damaged would have been 5 star
244,Samuel Olmedo,2022,5,"El producto llegó en perfecto estado hasta Panamá y funciona perfecto, es una gran consola y tiene buenos títulos"
245,Leon,2022,5,YEE.
246,Anthon,2022,5,Delivered as promised
247,Evan,2022,4,Great product and fast shipping but when I opened the box I found that one of the corners on the Xbox was slightly chipped. No significant damage though. Xbox works great!
248,Jena Jihyun Park,2022,5,The edge of the box was a bit damaged but it was also in another box and arrived in Japan with just a good condition. From California to Japan it took only a week.
249,Jesus Torres,2022,5,N/A
250,Jensen,2022,5,valió la pena esperar casi dos años me agregue a la invitación de amazon me enviaron un correo electrónico seleccionado para comprar la Xbox serie x no perdí la oportunidad y la compre al precio de $500 dolares americano muchas gracias
251,Celeste,2022,5,"My husband loved this gift, he says it’s a great improvement from the last Xbox he had! Decent price from this seller and fast shipping."
252,CW,2022,5,"Everywhere else was out of stock and charged a premium, but Amazon had it available and at the right price :)My Xbox series X is working very well and is super fast!"
253,Ryan O'Conner,2022,5,I have been playing the flight simulator on this thing and it is amazing. It's hard to believe how great the graphics are. I love this new xbox!
254,dalgian,2022,5,Im súper happy with my Xbox x
255,AmazonAJ,2020,5,"I've grown up mostly a Playstation gamer...ps1 to ps4. I had and enjoyed xbox 360 but PS was my go to.  That all changed when I bought the xbox one x and tried gamepass. What a game changer that combo was for me quite literally. The one x played 3rd party games better than the competition and gamepass was an incredible value. Backward compatibility was the bonus. I loved it.Series X continues that power and value proposition without the mistakes xbox made with the xbox one launch. Microsoft and xbox have really turned it around and have once again produced the monolith of power with Series x.Fast ssd, super smooth menus, 1440p/4k support, variable refresh rate, auto low latency, hard drive support, backwards compatible with games and accessories, gamepass, games optimized for series x or s, familiar yet just better controller, external ssd expansion card available, auto hdr... you get the drift.The series X is best most complete xbox I dare say ever produced. If your already an xbox gamer its a no brainer to upgrade... if your thinking about making the switch... this is the best xbox to get onto to.Its familiar yet improved in every way. The library of exclusives can and will get better but with optimized series x games and gamepass you'll be plenty busy.Happy gaming!"
256,private,2022,5,Much better graphics than my series S. Happy customer.
257,W. Phillips,2022,5,Thanks Amazon for creating this invitation process to buy high demand items.  I am enjoying my new system 😎
258,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Fast speeds
259,Jose,2022,5,I have been waiting for the XBox for a while and finally decided to get it for my son. We are both enjoying it!
260,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Excellent console
261,Matt Naber,2022,5,"Instant loading times, better quality of life experience overall when playing new and old games"
262,Anthony Wallace,2022,5,"After 13 years of exclusively PS ownership, this console is was brought me back into the Xbox fold. Performance wise it excels above the rest, and with Gamepass it easily makes it the best value for gaming today period. If you’ve been debating which console to make the leap on, toss in my vote on the Series X for sure. Happy Gaming!"
263,Mark,2022,5,Love this product but cost much!  Lol
264,Poor Soul,2022,4,"The best console Iv ever seen, massive library, backwards compatibility, amazing graphics, suspension play is insane, couldn’t be happier just a damn shame it’s so hard to find one at the 500$ price it’s supposed to have.Please don’t support the gougers.I hope the gougers go to hell when they die."
265,Steven Morden,2022,5,"I absolutely loved that Amazon offered this to Prime Members at cost of retail on realease date! If you missed out on the March 31, 2022 deadline, then im sorry. But only paying $499 for this next gen console was amazing when the only ones available were $1,100+! Thanks again, Amazon!This machine is definitely worth the wait to pay original retail price. True 4k and fast loads and more game playing. Love it."
266,Alex Kay,2022,5,"No lag, great UI- perfect console."
267,rui santos,2022,4,its great just like its predecessor but i bought the 1tb version and with only the games in my library most of it is used up already
268,Abiel M,2022,5,"Firstly, this Xbox is gonna need some room. Hot air comes out of the top so nothing should ever be over it when playing. The whole next gen of gaming is off to a good start. Booting up, loading screens, multiplayer, continuing your single player game all work pretty fast. I got lucky since Amazon was out of stock a few days after I bought it. Hopefully this shortage ends soon so more people can enjoy this Xbox, it's worth the money."
269,Giancarlo Mendoza Ortega,2022,5,Good Product
270,Phoenix Johnson,2022,5,"Item peerless! Refined packaging. Speedy delivery. Service was state-of-the-art. Very, very pleased."
271,Miguel Gonzalez III,2022,5,I'm grateful to be selected for the invitation to purchase this console. It is worth the time and effort.
272,Michael lind,2022,5,Very nice
273,Danny Livas,2021,5,"This was a HUGE step for me in gaming and I just can't understand the amount of hate in these reviews. The fact of the matter is that the middle man of any product must profit, otherwise there is no middle man. Aside from the price though, this console is incredible. Its speed and performance has highly impacted my gaming and it shows. I play Call of Duty Warzone and I beat everyone to the map whether it is multiplayer or warzone and not to mention I no longer experience weird situations where I should have won a shootout with someone. For example: I have a friend whom I always 1v1 and I thought he was the best player in the game beating me 60-20. But when I got this console I started beating him suddenly. I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD BEAT HIM. Also the speed and quick resume is an absolute blast. I can download games at 3-400 Mbps now and I no longer have to wait 2-3 hours but only 15-20 minutes. The amount of room that this thing has is great and overall this console is a work of art in my opinion."
274,Lokken,2022,5,Finally an honest price !
275,Dayne Jackson,2022,5,I’m always iffy buying things that aren’t directly from the brand they are for example Xbox’s site but my experience with this has been amazing. no issues with the xbox at all.
276,Diego David Casa,2022,5,The best console
277,Mandie,2020,5,"Coming from the Xbox One X I have personally noticed a giant different in smoothness and image quality with Gears 5. I played in awe the entire way through the game on the Series X. It’s a beautiful machine that performs well, and it has surpassed all of my expectations. Assassins Creed Valhalla was the game that really impressed me the most on performance mode. Any worries about no true next gen games went right out the window after playing this game. All games load super fast and it is fantastic. I’m used to loading a game, picking my phone, up and scrolling through social media, etc. With the Series X a game will load so fast that by the time I pick my phone up and open an app that I put it down right away, because I’m in the game already. Each game differs in loading time but boy this machine is fast. Quick Resume works well on older games, and another added bonus. The 4K player plays my movies and they look and sound beautiful as well. It’s also silent to my ears and it lives up to its hype. This was also a preorder and Amazon delivered on launch day and even early in the day as well."
278,Cody Welch,2022,5,"I was weary buying a Xbox Series X from a third party but I had seen that there were almost all perfect ratings for Joe’s Tech Shop out of Brooklyn, NY so I decided to take a chance. The console was like new in its original box and arrived two days early. Runs amazingly and if I ever shop for an electronic in the future and I see I can get it from Joe’s Tech Shop, I’m gonna pick them. 😁"
279,Jazzam,2022,5,"Lucky to have procured an Xbox series X on Amazon.  Been gaming for decades and have never seen such a value as xbox with gamepass.  Family uses the xbox series X everyday and we may have to buy another to satisfy the demand in this household.  Xbox and Gamepass Ultimate is the best gaming value ever especially for a family, my kids have endless games to play - everywhere and using microsoft rewards I have stockpiled almost two years of GPU out to 2024.  Haven't had a need to purchase a game in years!"
280,Victor L. Ashley Sr,2022,5,I have been playing Xbox games and had their consoles and systems since they came out. Xbox will always be my number one gaming system. Thank-you!
281,OFFICIAL MADE BEST,2022,5,Yeah got it for 499 brand new heavy has heck
282,Cory Hornbaker,2022,5,"The day of release, I was on my phone, refreshing like a mad man and got lucky and got one. Little did I know at the time how hard they would be to get to this day. Loads fast, runs quiet. Best gaming console around."
283,Jordan Alexander,2021,4,"This system was very easy to setup and looks amazing on my LG CX. With VRR and 120hz games look amazing such as halo. Amazon made it fairly simple to secure one with a little persistence.The only flaw I’m seeing is it does get quite hot, so ensure it has room to breathe. Also the VRR seems to have a slight flickering issue with my specific model of TV which is fixable and never present in my actual games.Highly recommended. If you looking for speed and high quality graphics for your 120hz 4K Dolby Vision OLED, go Xbox. If you want to exclusive games with slightly less power, go PS5. Both are great options this holiday."
284,Josh,2022,5,I’ve wanted this for the longest and I finally got it :)
285,Daniel ,2022,4,For me It’s the same gaming experience as the xbox one from 2013 with barely noticeable graphic improvements. But load times are sweet and no more lag spikes. Frame rate not much of a difference for now.
286,Matt Wenkman,2022,5,"Joining the gamer club late, but whatever!!! It’s ON."
287,James,2022,5,Its just as amazing as I hoped it would be!
288,Jeramiah Hughes,2022,5,I really do love this series X it is awesome but it will overheat the first time you get it but after that overheat it never overheated again but it’s nice and fast and powerful and overall great console
289,NSt,2022,4,"The installation was not as intuitive as one would expect. After several attempts and growing despair in my boy's eyes, it finally worked."
290,Sean Durment,2022,5,The product was shipped quickly and in good condition! Thank you!
291,Beder Galvan,2022,5,"A mi primo le gustó mucho la consola aunque el quería la edición de halo pero como está demasiado elevado en costo, se compró la edición normal y está encantantadisimo jugando no deja de usarlo le encanta y los gráficos son muy buenos"
292,Christopher Savok,2022,5,I love the Xbox and that I finally got the newest console
293,Patrick R,2022,2,"Bought the X Box Series X and 3 games (disc versions) and my machine scratched 2 disc's so the games were unplayable. One deep scratch on each within 2 days of ownership. The disc's are either too prone to scratching, the machine is defective or Microsoft just wants you getting the download versions. The machine was set on its side, as I read it wss more prone to scratching disc's standing upright.Update: occasionally the machine just doesn't want to read discs. Microsoft has an issue with the disc player that could result in you having to send the unit back to MS for repair. System restarts seem to make the games playable again. I've noticed turning off the machine with disc inside increases likelihood of problems, as does inserting a disc while machine is booting up. Currently, I exit the game, remove disc, and do a full system shut down and I've not experienced a disc read error again."
294,Kathy,2022,2,"For the insane cost of the system I am very disappointed with the game availability and how they keep releasing new games that are no better than a new beta version yet charge $70+ dollars for it, I feel Microsoft has really dropped the ball recently and would REALLY appreciate a refund on this system or at the very least a store credit, but I won't hold my breath since I know their customer support does nothing besides make excuses and never try to help the customer out. Would be amazed if they prove me wrong and reach out to rectify the situation and would immediately change review to elaborate on what they did to fix it but again chances of that happening are slim to none so I wouldn't recommend anyone spend their hard earned money on this machine. To be continued..... Maybe?"
295,Nicholas,2022,5,Good Product
296,Clint Noland,2022,5,works great
297,Cameron,2021,5,"The Xbox Series X overall is exceptionally neat console with tons of amazing cutting edge features, superb graphical specs (actually a bit superior to the PS5), Xbox Game Pass subscription offering true value for your money, controller every bit as great as the Xbox One controller, and a overall clean fast paced experience. Only downside to the Series X right now is a weak 1st/2nd party exclusive library at the moment, but it should obviously get better overtime for years to come.But other than that, the Xbox Series X as a console is a huge improvement over the Xbox One (which admittedly was indeed a disappointing console) and the current overall direction that Phil Spencer and Microsoft have for Xbox I hope they will stick with that strategy for many years to come. If you can find it at the right price (no more than the suggested $500 MSRP price), I truly recommend the Xbox Series X (or Series S if you don't care about 4K & wanna save some money)."
298,Ian,2020,5,"The size of the console is so compact, it runs whisper quiet and improves upon most backward compatible titles.4K HDR, 120 FPS, 1440P support, even Dolby vision is supported on the console.You will get about 800GB usable space from the SSD for your games. Eventually you may have to spill for the 1TB sea gate expansion card. However, the best thing to do is use a USB 3.0 external HDD for your older games and put the new games on your main SSD.Currently there is an issue with VRR via HDMI at 4K. Variable refresh rate on certain TVs like LG and Panasonic. Microsoft is aware and will patch this via a software update. In the meantime, you can either turn VRR off on your Xbox video settings or run it at 1440p/1080p which works fine.Gamepass is the best value in gaming right now, Destiny 2 and the new expansion are on it.UI is running butter smooth and games are launching instantly. Right now there aren’t many new releases of games, but as time goes on there will be more titles to take advantage of this beast.Microsoft made an amazing console that will only age better over time."
299,Zayden Fisher,2022,5,sus
300,JAZ,2021,4,"I have had several Xbox's over the years, going back to the 360 era. I managed to get this day one and have been very happy to have it. I replaced my Xbox One X with this, as my One X was struggling to play games like Red Dead Redemption 2 without sounding like it was going to take off. With the Series X, I can play RDR2 without any noise from the console. Everything looks better too on this compare to the One X. Now there have been some hiccups here or there since launch but Microsoft have done a good job so for with trying to fix things. My major issue are the controller not syncing when the batteries die and having the restart the console to get it to sync, some games won't quick resume and that causes all the other game and apps not to launch, and games like Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War crashing all the time. The first two are Microsoft's problems, while the last one is the devs. Overall, it's a good console and for most will be worth the upgrade."
301,Jay Gonzalez,2020,5,"It is an amazing console... I find it ridiculous how some of the negative reviews are based on no exclusives at launch. Like didn't they know that before pre ordering?The fact that I still haven't played many titles due to my busy life, there are so may games I can play off the bat on day one with this console. The fact that every game I played on the Series X runs so fast with loading time, and higher and steadier frame rates impresses me. Definitely a great upgrade from my Xbox One X to the Series X.I was able to simply use the 2 hard drives I had on the One X to the Series X with no problem, but if I want to play a game where I would want the Series X to take advantage of speed and performance, I would have it in the Series X's Internal drive, or in the SSD Seagate 1TB that goes behind the console.$500 for what it includes on the specs alone is a heck of a deal.5/5 No doubt. Xbox and Microsoft did an amazing job witwith this console in every way."
302,edward,2022,5,"very satisfied with purchase, i found it cheaper than most, directly from amazon, it took about a week more than estimated time, but it arrive safe and sound. Highly recommended"
303,Mauricio Rosales,2022,5,I’m just excited I was able to purchase through invitation.
304,Malcolm,2021,4,"I honestly wish Microsoft did something more. Not with the physical Xbox that is. I like the design and it is definitely packing a good amount of power for what you pay.However, I honestly did not feel like I was jumping into a new console generation as I had with previous generations.The UI is the same as it is on the Xbox One and One X, the controller is virtually the same (they added a share button to the new one, WOO-HO!) and there hasn't been a lot of new first-party Xbox games since the launch in November.I wish they would've given us a new UI, new controller, and some more games. Coming from an Xbox One X, I really haven't felt that feeling of excitement as I have with new console generations in the past.I do not think I am the only one that feels this way either, as I have read all over people feeling the same way. I know Microsoft is banking big on Game Pass and cloud gaming, but eh. Still miss that feeling of excitement."
305,Mitchell J.,2022,5,Only thing I didn't like was the packaging was that the Xbox box was put into another box with side having bubble wrap to fill the gap. That being said the Xbox itself was fully protected because it was unopened. So full 5 stars! I was surprised that the Xbox arrived 4 days earlier than its estimated date and is in full working condition. I only paid the over price because any location here that gets the series x is filling someone else's order or the staff will buy them so the chance of getting one is near 0.
306,Corvus,2022,5,"I’ve owned every Xbox generation from the beginning, and the X is just the latest in the line of consoles.I’ll only compare it to the Xbox One and the Series S, however. The biggest upgrade is to performance: most games I play no longer have loading times outside of connection strength. Even compared to the economical little sister in the Series S, the X has more power playing games.10/10, would buy again (just not for $600 plus tax)"
307,Trenton P Mongillo,2020,5,"Everything youve come to expect in a console launch. Polished hardware, subtle redesign of the included controller (1). Comes with a high speed hdmi 2.1 cable. The power brick is all internal and has a normal cable for power supply. If you are giving this as a holiday gift, consider powering it up before hand, it has approximately 900MB update to do right out of the box. The controller needs to be updated as well. You can use a smart phone and the xbox app to set up profiles and settings from your previous xbox one. You can also transfer your digital games from your xbox one over your own network instead of downloading them all from the xbox servers. Be warned! Digital game downloads can take hours to install depending on your internet connection.Great tech in this product. I like the future proof cables for when I decide to upgrade. Awesome form factor and it runs quiet and stays cool.Game pass is a must for xbox. Save thousands on games and have so many to choose from. With the latest additions of EA Play and Disney+ there is too much value for the consumer to pass up."
308,Dustin Raphael,2020,4,"I was supposed to get this on launch day but for some reason it stayed around in Georgia for 24 hours. I got it on the 11 and I noticed that a screw was loose. Not a little screw either but a big one. Doesn't even seem like the kind of screw that would even be used in the console. I wedged it into a corner because I didn't have any tools on me that could pull it out and then I tried the system out to see if it would run. I had it running for over 7 hours with no issues.  I have something that can pull the screw out at work and I will bring that to home with me to remove the screw. I saw a few reports of the screws falling out of other people's series x but the screws I've seen don't look like the one I have. Just wanted to mention this incase Microsoft, Amazon, or a potential customer is looking at reviews. I'm going to keep the system but if it dies on me after the return window closes I will forever curse the name Microsoft and the year 2020."
309,David H.,2022,5,"Nice design, runs extremely cool.  Doesn't even dump heat into the room."
310,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Since the launch of the series x/s I’ve had the series s and it was great. I really wanted to get my hands on the series x but for the longest time they were sold out or ridiculously overpriced. I finally managed to get my hands on one and I was so excited. I will say if you do not have a 4k tv that’s able to do 120fps (which I happen to have) don’t bother with this one and settle for the series s it’s a perfect alternative.
311,Nathaniel,2022,5,
312,RAYRAY INKY PATTON,2022,5,Wonderful!!
313,ERiKboBARIK,2022,2,"I have had the console since launch. It is an excellent console, very well built. I love the backgrounds as well, they look neat. The controller is nice and the Master Chief Elite controller is the best controller I have ever used.The dashboard for the console is awful. Navigating the console menus is terrible. The photo video editing software is awful as well.The first party games are lacking as well. I played Gears 5 on it. I loved Gears 1-3 but was immediately turned off by 5 as the first thing I saw when I launched the game were $20. The campaign was a good one time play through. I struggled to get through the open worlds a second time as they are empty, pointless and out right boring. I loved the linear chapters, I thought they were great. I quickly grew bored of the multiplayer as it hasn’t changed since Gears 2 (I can’t believe there is still sticky cover).I played Halo Infinite and the game is unfinished. They continue to add cosmetics instead of content like maps. I grew bored of the game after a month.I am looking forward to Fable and Hellblade 2, but remain skeptical because of Microsoft’s heavy monetization practices. The focus seems to be on heavily monetizing first party games since they are available on GamePass. That is a huge turn off for the console.I do love some of the backwards compatible games, tbough most of the games I want remain unavailable.At this point, I haven’t touched the console in a few months as the GamePass games have been uninteresting for me personally. I can’t believe Halo, the launch title for this console, was unfinished and a massive disappointment. I just can’t wait for some great first party games, hopefully sooner rather than later and with no heavy monetization. I am also extremely disappointed to hear that Microsoft is already giving up on future backwards compatible titles from the 360 era as that was the best part about the console."
314,Gayle Turner,2022,5,Awesome upgrade shipping was faster than expected the tracking didn't show any information but its Here
315,David,2020,5,"As soon as I opened the package I was in awe with how beautifully it was packaged, it’s super solid and sturdy. Plugging it in was very easy, no more power bricks, just one cord straight from the Xbox to the wall. Turned it on and it was like magic. Instantly started downloading games, and they look stunning! I have played Forza Horizon 4, Fallout 4, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Dirt 4, and each load super quick. Huge leap from the load times of the Xbox one. In fallout 4, I can fast travel and have it loaded to the next place in about 5 seconds. Graphics of optimized games such as Forza look so much better than I expected. Everything is super fast, next to no wait times, and runs super smoothly. Quick resume works very well, loads back into the game within 10 seconds right where I left off. Controller feels very good in my hands, textured triggers are amazing. Super simple setup, gorgeous graphics, very short load times, very very smooth gameplay. All in all, was 1000x better than expected. Couldn’t be happier. I use a 27” 4K monitor."
316,Fadi k,2022,5,"Best graphics, best price, backward compatible even with the original Xbox games. What else can I say"
317,James G,2022,5,"I am a PS5 fanboy. I’ve always had PlayStations with an Xbox here or there but not my preferred system. I got a PS5 and loved it not really considering the Xbox until Amazon started offering them to Prime members. Upon getting and using this thing I must admit I find it better than the PS5.The design, game pass, parts, even the controller is amazing though the PS5 controller is amazing too. This is now my preferred console."
318,tmann4usa,2022,5,Item arrive in perfect  condition ever thing working OK enjoying  playing games with my granddaughter
319,Timothy G.,2022,5,"The console arrived on time. Console working great and is everything that was said about the new Xbox series X,  Its awesome.  I waited until it was in stock to buy my new Xbox Series X..  stock has met demand and at the price its suppose to be $499. Great Job Amazon! I know alot of people will be trying to get one now that they are coming back in Stock.. The Xbox Series X is Just Awesome."
320,Ashley,2022,5,"I love the quality, detail and all about that Xbox"
321,Taylor S,2022,5,I had an Xbox Series S for about 2 to 3 months as I was too impatient to wait until the Series X was more available. Thankfully Amazon had a good amount of stock of the Series X and I finally got one.The picture on the Series X is awesome! I can tell the difference in picture between the Series S and Series X. Very pleased with my purchase.
322,Infernal♤Cognition,2022,5,I absolutely love my Xbox Series X. The quick resume feature is something I actually use more often than I would've thought and having basically no wait time on loading screens is choice. Definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a next gen gaming console.
323,will Garey,2022,5,"Product was delivered on time, works great. Overall great experience!"
324,Tim and Cheryl Price,2022,5,Great for my gaming setup
325,Import562,2022,5,So far so good hooked it up and it’s going fine I could say for paying $599 instead of $499 it ain’t that bad I seen these go for $899 waiting for the price to drop and I said why not let’s see how it goes my Xbox one still works and runs fine to this day so I hope this X does the same and last a long time.
326,Corban Roberts,2022,5,Ordered an open-box Xbox Series X and the product came very quickly looking brand new. No complaints!
327,Kermit L.,2022,5,I I love everything about my Xbox series X The company I ordered it from was called Always innovating the package was packed very nicely the Box had no damage the system was amazing and the package got to me very fast
328,ELDON KORNELSEN,2022,5,"Don't get me wrong, almost a month is awhile, but the xbox series x is amazing."
329,Andrew B.,2022,5,There's so many attachments that you can get lol
330,Eric,2022,2,"This was supposed to be a brand new Xbox One X.. but it has been malfunctioning since Day One.Each time I open the store, it says that it needs to be updated.When I'm playing a game, the screen will turn off for 5-7 seconds, then turn back on.  (Makes it a bit difficult to stay alive.)All in all.. I wouldn't recommend buying this product from here.  Get it somewhere you can test it."
331,Brandon,2022,4,You can’t go wrong with this Xbox series X!!! I’ve had every Xbox that has come out. This system is so fast and quiet!!! Team Xbox for life.
332,Noah Marston,2022,5,"Processes so much faster. All my games work better. Everything runs so so so, smoothly. I love it! Yes I wish it wasn't so expensive but the more I use it, it's sooo worth it!"
333,Luis Rojas,2022,5,"Top quality, great performance and nice look!"
334,Dear MR.J,2021,4,"I was one of the few lucky buyers who got this Xbox and I do enjoy playing console games a lot.  This Xbox was short in stock and I've waited so long to get one.  The gaming experience is smooth and fast.  The graphics look smooth and sharp on my 4K TV. I do find the games somewhat expensive.  I've noticed it will crash sometimes for no reason. So far, it has been a great console and my friends love coming over for games."
335,Eric,2022,5,I think the graphics are a little better than my old Xbox one s but best of all NO MORE CRASHING when I’m playing borderlands or halo.  Price gougers are still selling these things for like $800 on eBay so Definetly don’t give package thieves the opportunity when yours is delivered.
336,Jerry Jennings,2021,4,"Xbox X is great as a new gen console, but unless you are an avid gamer that is in need of more memory, a nice display, and a disk drive, save 200 and opt in for the Xbox S. I've played a friend of mines xbox s and we have the same exact experience so could only recommend the X if you are interested in playing games on the disc. However, for a casual gamer that has an xbox to play with guest in the living room, the X is overkill for me"
337,Angel,2022,4,Console was delivered very fast and the condition was brand new and great price is above the original 500$ but it was worth to pay an extra 160-180$ the console itself is a beast and looks amazing
338,Shawn Andrew,2022,5,Yeah was sceptical about this but when I got it this really was a series x very happy about it I recommend you to get the new not used or good
339,Jonathan L.,2022,5,It's got the same ui as the Xbox one series but has better performance than the playstation as sony can't fix system errors as swiftly as xbox does
340,Jeff,2022,5,Got lucky and randomly checked to see if it was available. Got it from Amazon so I didn't get screwed on the price.It's been really fun playing on it. Everything is really fast and load times are minuscule. Everything looks great in 4k too.
341,Emily,2022,4,"Pairing wireless headphones are a pain, but otherwise it's great, and this is coming from a playstation girl"
342,User456,2022,5,I like that the seller replaced the used to new chords and controller of purchasing a used Xbox Series X I did not expect getting a brand new Xbox controller.
343,Victor,2022,3,"Tan solo duró 2 meses bn y después fallo,póngale garantía cuando la compren"
344,Richard G Paez Jr,2022,5,"I have been playing Xbox since the original . What an upgrade in technology when I got my series x. Not only the colors, but the SPEED is outstanding. My games load and update much quicker so I playing more instead of waiting. Great buy and worth every penny !!!!"
345,Chris Rederstorf,2022,2,"I absolutely love the new XBox Series X. I was pretty disappointed on how the Xbox was packaged for shipment. It was put in a regular brown cardboard box, a bit bigger than the manufacturer’s package the Xbox was in. There was no packaging material to help keep the Xbox from moving around, and after opening the shipping box I double checked the gaming system to make sure nothing was damaged. Luckily nothing was. I believe items as expensive as this computer system should be handled with better care, especially the price I’m paying for it."
346,Meghan Pennington,2020,5,"Let me start off by saying I am not an Xbox fan boy lol. I have mostly played PS4 and PC  in the past few years. I was very intrigued with Xbox series X because of the user experience. They really seem like they were listening with this generation and it shows. The UI interface is like butter it moves so quickly, with hardly any waiting. Game pass which is an amazing option only on Xbox and PC has an amazing selection of games right at my fingertips for a monthly fee. Xbox really got the user experience down I can honestly say that it was definitely worth it. I've been enjoying a lot of games that I played on PC and I am confident in saying that I have such a great experience on Xbox series X I'm blown away. It gets a little hot but I have it in a very breathable location. ( I would recommend that as well ) I'm excited to play all the Xbox one games I missed out on! (And new games of course) Overall I really recommend it."
347,Jose Gonzalez,2022,5,Loading times much faster that Xbox one... Love the new controller...
348,PKL,2022,5,"Great console! I like everything about it. It doesn't take up much room and the graphics on games are so much more crisp and clear; the colors are even brighter.The only thing I am concerned about is this thing really puts out some heat. I think I may have to get an attachment fan for it....seriously, it's like a mini heater.You can dress it up with skins, cubes and more.....my son absolutely loves it!!!"
349,Joshua Barajas,2021,5,"I’m so happy with my purchase, I’ve had it since November and it’s served me great. Apps start up so much faster than the old generation. If you don’t play too many games that are Series X|S enhanced I recommend you get a hard drive. The games won’t start up as fast but it won’t take up ssd storage for games that are optimized. I play quite a few games ranging from FPS to Racing. And I’ve noticed the console gets warmer on Forza Horizon 4 compared to Call Of Duty or Rainbow Six Siege. The 120 FPS is phenomenal, and for those who may not know, you can play at 120 FPS with HDMI 2.0 as long as it’s a 120+ hz screen. For 4K 120 FPS you need hdmi 2.1 which is harder to find. So if you want to play 120 FPS make sure the monitor you buy is capable of 120hz and has HDMI 2.0 and up."
350,Sweetness 198,2022,5,The amazing details we can now see in all of the graphics along with the quick loading speeds make upgrading from the Xbox One worth it!
351,hybrid,2022,4,"I'm more familiar with the XBox controller so transitioning from an XBox 360 wasn't too bad at all.Good for sports games. Even for my little tiny monitor. I don't really take advantage of 4K, but this system should last a long while.Now time to get a PS5 :)"
352,Giovanni Ambriz,2022,5,I had no disappointments. The series X is a power house of a console that makes not only load times faster but every thing faster. Installing games is faster loading apps on the Xbox is faster and it does this without any fan noise. Games also look great at 4k. The only thing I don’t like is the UI is the same as the last generation Xbox.
353,Scott,2022,5,Bought as a gift. Was delivered in a timely fashion.  Tracking was available almost immediately. The xbox was a 100% new unit and perfect. Would buy again.
354,Runflatvet,2022,3,My gaming PC works better than this does!
355,Josh Hutton,2022,5,If you're an XBOX fan. you'll love this. It plays my old XBOX games too. Couldn't be happier.
356,Courtney. K.,2022,5,"They were in stock for a short time in April of 2022 I believe at normal retail price, shipped and delivered within a few days completely sealed and new!"
357,Mateus,2022,5,seller response was prompt and helpful. product arrived on time and works and looks like new. great purchase! definitely recommend!
358,Jacob Wentao Guo,2022,5,The console arrived sealed. Everything looks good. The only complaint I have is the slow shipping. Could be better if the shipping is faster
359,Trkoyse,2020,5,"Coming from an Xbox One X I can say this does feel like a next-gen leap, albeit not a huge one as of yet.The console is quiet, and the use of an SSD this generation means a very responsive UI and faster load times for games. There are a handful of Series X optimized games available but not a bunch. I bought Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition to go with this and the differences are noticeable. In addition to improved graphics and faster load times the Series X also beings Ray Tracing which made this particular game look even better.To summarize the console delivers on bringing a next-gen feel and if you have a One X already there are differences that make the purchase feel welcome. Granted, with the short supply of games out there using this to its fullest at this time, you would be forgiven for waiting a little longer to buy this. But for those that buy it now or plan to buy it, I can definitely recommend this."
360,Matthew Chase,2022,5,"Love that I was able to get my hands on this system. I have no complaints about; it’s great! Now, if only I could get my hands a ps5 too that would be great."
361,Nolan,2022,5,Packaging for the series x is incredible!  I almost felt like I should not take it out of the box because it was perfectly wrapped and stored.  No issues at all and the system runs great!
362,Michael,2022,5,Works perfectly and manufacturing date is March 2022 which I was happy to see
363,fred420170,2022,3,Happy that I was finally able to get the series x.  However the box was all banged up and there were shipping stickers all over it.  I like to keep my boxes for moving or storage.  It works fine just not happy with the state in which the box arrived..
364,Justin,2022,5,"Can not wait to play games on this thing, mostly for the newly released Elden Ring. Upgraded from an Xbox Series S just so I could play disc games again. Totally worth it. Would recommend getting dust filters for it as, as there's not much stopping anything from flying on/into it. I'm also getting a cooling stand for it, but not because it runs hot or anything, just to improve the air circulation and lifespan of it as much as possible."
365,John,2022,5,Load times much faster
366,Lucas,2022,2,Almost every time I turn my brand f****** new xbox X on I have to turn it off hold the xbox button power button-down And then reconnect to the Wi-Fi all over again every single f****** time I get on  Because it will not save the Wi-Fi data at all what the f*** Because of this defect I would value this at half of what it's worth Because of the absolute pain in the a** it is to try and play it.
367,Nick,2022,5,Was nervous buying something so expensive online but the product was exactly what I’d hoped for. It came packaged decently and there was no damage. It also came a week earlier than initially estimated which was a pleasant surprise. I would definitely order from this company again.
368,sean p.,2022,3,I purchased the Xbox very excited and I had received it and the console looked brand new I was disappointed when I had received a very used controller with dirt still in the crevices and the power cord sent with it did not work I had to use the cord out of my series s XD most confusing purchase I ever made
369,Dermeister,2022,5,"Everything is correct, they just brought it to my country, I'm playing, good seller, a little more expensive, but what else is there if you want to have the console?"
370,Amazon Customer,2022,5,It's an xbox
371,Chris,2022,5,It’s been a blast playing on this lil machine. Been on the PlayStation bandwagon for the last 15 years- crossed over to the ‘dark side’ - no regrets. Rediscovered my love for gaming again. Gamepass is awesome too.
372,Saint,2022,5,Playing online the speed is incredible. The graphics online is awesome. Playing games not online the Xbox one X  is just as good. But if your looking a great online experience. This is it.
373,Rafa,2020,5,
374,Truitt Wilson,2020,5,"Design:Smaller than you expect for a console that has this kind of performance.Controller:Feels great in your hand, has better latency than any previous xbox controller. Pairs and connects to the Xbox when powering on nearly instantly, which is a nice improvement from previous controllers.Performance:The level of graphical quality, FPS, and speed of the SSD make this the best console on the market. It accomplishes this all while being dead quiet and impressively cool.Features:Microsoft's implementation of Quick Resume and the velocity architecture makes switching between multiple games a breeze and actually incentives you to try different titles. The thoughts of not wanting to load up a new game because it would take too long to load up are gone forever with this generation.Conclusion:Microsoft has pulled out all the stops hardware and OS-wise. Once next generation games come out, the Xbox Series X will be the best way to game for years to come."
375,Honeykz,2022,5,La neta me encantó los juegos se ven brutal y ni hablar del microsoft flight simulator 2020
376,Brayan Nahun Urbina Garcia,2022,5,Excellent console.
377,Jess A.,2022,5,Very happy with the product. Super fast load times and the picture is stellar with 4k and 120 hz.
378,Khuram Jamil,2022,5,"Legit what I asked for from Xbox. This has to be the best console ever bro. I love the speeds, 120hz, 4K, and everything else it comes with. If you new to console gaming and want a next gen console get the Xbox Series X."
379,Jermaine Edwards,2022,5,"At first I kept going back and forth between the Xbox and PS5, but after researching I chose the Xbox series X. It was the best decision. I am very happy with it and excited with the game pass store."
380,Guy H. Lane,2022,5,my son has wanted one for over a year. but i would not pay the premium most were asking. got this one at 499 dollars!!!! still can't believe it being a Prime Member has it's perks.
381,Judy Moore,2022,5,loving the next gen so far no compliantsthank you again amazon i was so hyped for this one and had every right to be.
382,Jamaal wallace,2022,5,I'm happy
383,rocketboy2k,2022,5,After waiting… basically since the drop… lucked up on restock and it is noticeably better than my previous series S… don’t buy overpriced.. just be patient… well worth waiting.
384,ChynaBsNdaTrap,2022,5,Faster upload speed and connectivity. Still issues with game servers which the console can’t control. Brand new from Xbox $499
385,Matt,2021,5,I’ve had my series X for about a year since it first dropped and I just have to say yes. Everything about it is great the load times are fast amazing picture and the cross gen feature is amazing. I could literally put my Xbox 360 games in and play it just fine. Also my old tv doesn’t support the 4K 120hz (I upgraded now) and the picture was still great most def worth the price. (Also it’s size is good because it’s honestly not even that big and you can’t even hear the fan)
386,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"Even slightly over MSRP, this console is a solid deal. Ray tracing, a 1 TB SSD, (only a few sadly) 120 FPS games, and a disk drive. Only gripe is the lack of new games."
387,Keith M,2020,5,"I'm one of those gamers that buys both Sony and Microsoft systems each go 'round. With the XSX, presentation was everything. From opening up the box and seeing how MS wrapped the XSX, it felt like I bought a premium product. Power up your new system, and you can transfer your existing content over in a flash. I love the SSD, and how quickly everything boots up compared to the previous  One X/S...Seeing NBA 2K21 upgraded is amazing! It's like a totally new game from the One X/S version I was playing. The XSX is whisper quiet..You'll barely notice it's on. Gamepass ultimate is an amazing bargin! My only wish is that MS had some New launch games, but with 2020 being what it is, I understand...I'll still enjoy the games I recently purchased, and the upgraded games like MK11, NBA 2K21, MADDEN 21, COD MW, ORI, AND FORZA HORIZON 4..The future is bright ."
388,Tomas Rinne,2022,5,I was a little unsure about fitting this into my budget but after high praises from my friends I was convinced and was not disappointed. This Xbox is an amazing upgrade and I will never go back.
389,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Everything is as advertised! Still had the Microsoft seals on the box and everything.
390,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Retail priced series x. Works fantastic and I didn’t overpay
391,yourboyvip,2022,5,
392,Graciela castaneda,2022,5,I’m happy with this purchase because the package was sealed I clearly opened everything up for the first time. The console itself runs smoothly I would definitely recommend other buyers
393,Kimberly Mesa,2022,5,Good Product
394,skylar,2022,5,A little overpriced but hey stuff nowadays are getting expensive anyways. Loaded it all up and it works great played for about 6 hours straight and no complaints here was worried been seeing a lot of bad reviews on the new xboxs but so far all is good thank you
395,De’Angelo Gonzales,2022,5,11/10 piece of tech
396,iKryptolyte,2022,5,"Excellent product. So dang fast. So glad I upgraded. Great shipping, box not damaged."
397,Drehood,2022,5,Incredible system!
398,David Laudolff,2022,4,great product.
399,David hirsch,2022,5,I think it works perfectly and is the faster version Xbox in my opinion
400,Bias Sucks USA,2022,5,"Best gaming console I’ve ever purchased. Graphics, sound and speed unmatched in the gaming space."
401,Patrick Johnson,2022,5,It's awesome. I love the faster speeds due to the ssd. Little pricey for a external ssd but Microsoft has always been that way. Graphics are cool with the right set up and better games that take advantage of the hardware later in the future.
402,Elijah Long,2022,5,"You get exactly what you ask for which is amazing, got the fast shipping as well, and it came in three days. Highly recommend."
403,Kara Wilcox,2021,5,"Talk about BEAUTY! The color, graphics, of games is UNREAL, quite system, controllers even more comfortable and last longer. The home screen and online format/homescreen is absolutely, positively user friendly. I absolutely LOVE how the Online Screen format is set up! With buying games, controls, etc, it’s absolutely perfect. Have had since launch, still ZERO problems. Microsoft knocked it outta the park with this one. And ANY bad reviews, are just former employees or PSN fan boys"
404,Janice,2022,5,I paid a little more than the store price but I got a brand new console as advertised from the 6ave seller. I upgraded from my ps4 pro and it was definitely worth it as everything is crazy fast and I can finally play older games I still like without having to use multiple consoles.
405,weaponx88,2022,1,"Not impressed. This is what the XB One should have been. The dash is exactly as it is on the XB One so you immediately get the impression of no upgrade to ""Next gen"". Absolute failure on Micros part. Pure laziness. One star for better game load times but you can get that with ""upgrading"" your XB One and saving $$$$$. Games ""Enhanced for XB X"" show zero difference at all whatsoever so Micro must use a different dictionary defining ""enhanced"". I don't follow PS5 so I don't know or care what they have but the games on this X are pretty pathetic. The current gen of gamers must be so easily amused or enjoy the same games over and over  since they all look like repeats of last gen. Nothing new, nothing appealing. Gamepass is just as bad. Maybe nobody makes ""new"" games anymore. The games ""on sale"" on gamepass are ALWAYS the same garbage. The controller felt weird in my hands as I hated the texture they put on it. It felt like sand. Glad the original Xbox One S controller worked on it. Oh yeah, they added a new animation when you turn it on (woopty doo) then it takes you to the exact same dash. So nothing new. If Micro had actually put some time into overhauling the dash instead of being lazy and keeping the old one it may have been better but other wise it feels the same as XB One. Oh and all the marketing teraflops, wifi, blah blah blah......not even noticeable and not worth $500. Returned. Keep your XB Ones and upgrade it with ext SSD instead of forking out $500 for faster game load times."
406,albert truong,2022,2,"the console disconnects from wifi constantly - every 20-30 mins- end up having to reboot it all the time.Have tried various fixes from what i scoured on the googles (seperate 2.4 and 5ghz ssid's for example). What eventually worked to have stable wifi was disabling WPA2, which i didnt like.Ended up using an old router that was AC compatible and ethernet wired the X to the router, then bridged it to our wifi.disappointed in the $$$ paid for this issue, which has been ongoing since its launch. simple google search will show other users with same issue."
407,sue boyd,2020,5,"...for Santa to let me buy this. First off, I understand that I got extremely lucky and happened to see a surprise shipment of these that Amazon got the first week of December. I was able to buy it at MSRP and received my series X the next day. And WOW. I love this console. The load times are non existent. I have a low latency 4k TV and the image is amazing! Even early Cyberpunk runs perfect with nearly no load times. I have been gaming since the first NES came out in the 80s and this is the most polished gaming console I've ever experienced. I know others may have issues and the war with PS5 will be brutal... but I am having a blast. So far there isn't a single thing I'd change. X Series and Gamepass is the best gaming value this year."
408,Edwin,2022,5,Very fast shipping and great condition :)!!!
409,Jennifer Collier,2021,5,"I had an Xbox One from 2015.  Not One S or One X but the base model.  It was a great console but the load times on many newer games were less than optimal.  This console comes equipped with a 1 TB solid state hard drive, which reduces the load times to almost nothing.  Great for staying immersed in the game.  You can expand your storage with a 1 TB expansion card.  Said card is overpriced but that's another story.I've had a 4K TV for years but my Xbox One only did 1080p (the One X is the only one that does 4K).  All my games look amazing in 4K and I'm glad I took the plunge."
410,Adrian K.,2022,5,"Works like new, it also came way earlier than I thought it would which is great as the weather is too damp at the moment. 👍"
411,Lance stenfeldt,2022,5,
412,Jean Rosario Figueroa,2021,5,
413,David ,2021,5,"I was very skeptical and cautious when dealing with Amazon sellers of this product. But I took a chance and was very surprised and relieved.  I researched the ratings for each seller and settled on this seller because of his good rating. Didn't like spending the STEEP price for the Series X, but kicked the money out anyway because the landscape for getting these consoles are extremely limited at best.But I loved the quick response and delivery of my Series X.  It took only 4 days for delivery. Very impressed and satisfied in getting this new console."
414,Aurora,2022,5,I'm glad I searched it up on April 1st 2022 I got lucky and was able to get one for it's actual price. I love it. Best purchase ever this year for me.
415,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Worth the wait but grab the external 2tb with it cause after a couple of large downloads uses majority of the hard drive
416,Cullen Jonathan Chatman,2022,5,I love my series X so much shoutout to Amazon on the speedy delivery
417,Jesse,2022,5,like to say the wait paid off and getting this bad boy at cost instead of 400 plus over selling price. i hope the rest of ya get this too while its available. good luck and game on
418,Josh,2022,5,"Finally able to get it, love it"
419,Tommy Cantrell,2022,5,"Product arrived as described, no issues. Works great."
420,Stacy,2022,5,Nice upgrade from Xbox one X. Faster and much better graphics.
421,david,2022,5,"I have always been a Playstation guy, but now that I own a PS5 and Bbox series x; I can say in my opinion the Xbox is the better of the two."
422,Branko,2022,5,It arrived safely. No major problems. Only thing I'd suggest is a bigger box and more safety packaging because you know how delivery drivers are. Box was a little scuffed but it was nothing major. 100% recommend
423,Zack Rowe,2020,1,
424,Victor C.,2022,5,This is my favorite console I’ve ever owned. So worth the wait! Cant wait to see the future of gaming on this bad boy.
425,Captain Awesome Pants,2022,5,I wish it was a PS5 but it’s not. So in spite of that heart breaking detail I still like it.
426,dan,2022,5,
427,Toderick Bryant,2022,5,Glad I finally got one. It's worth every penny I paid for it.
428,Jesse,2020,5,Xbox Series X is everything I hope and dreamed it would be! The first game I played on it was Assassin's Creed:Valhalla! It looks absolutely amazing! 4k resolution at 60 frames per second! Load times are extremely quick thanks to the custom SSD Harddrive. The new Controller is pretty awesome too. It has new grips on the back of the controller and also on the triggers. There is also a new share button on it that allows you to take screenshots of the games you are playing. If you hold the button down it records a game clip. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is really awesome with Xbox Series X. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now includes EA play at no additional cost. EA Play contains over 70 games. I highly recommend getting an Xbox Series X if you want to experience true next gen gaming!
429,kelly carr,2022,5,I was worried a little but it came quick and system works great been playing it
430,sergio,2022,5,Todo está perfecto muy recomendada esta empresa no eh tenido ningún problema!
431,Ridge Tawdrous,2020,4,"I liked that this came on time, unlike another order I had from Amazon. It was an early Christmas gift for a friend and he honestly loved it, the resolution is really high and you can tell there was a nice amount of work done and considering I have the Xbox one s, I can especially tell the difference. However, I do not like the shape nor the price, for a 560 price tag you would expect something extra like a second controller or, who knows a headset or something, but nothing. The packaging was kinda nifty tho where it wasn’t a traditional Xbox box. I also did not like the way it was super vertical so I can’t really find a good spot to fit it now without blocking the screen or put it on the floor and hope no one topples it’s over :/"
432,Bryan D.,2022,5,It’s good
433,M. Crosby,2022,2,I was unable to use my blue yeti usb microphone and I could not use my headphone without a janky adapter connected to the controller. Also why doesn't Microsoft have a direct integration with you tube you shouldn't need to use a computer with streamlabs to stream to you tube it's 2022 for Christ's Sake
434,Ines Siegel ,2022,5,📦 perfect. Works great  ❤️ my new system.
435,Mason Moore,2022,4,the price was higher than regular but cheaper than others I have seen. the shipping was super fast and everything was packaged very well and in working condition.
436,Heonseop Sim,2021,5,The price point on this is beyond fair you're getting the Hottest console and the 1TB Seagate proprietary memory card together I don't know what all these people in the review section are complaining about a 550$ and a 250$ dollar item oh man and extra 50 bucks that's not a crazy mark up at all great price and recommended to my Guy whom I game with so he can get in on a great deal too as believe me the games are huge and you'll soon be finding yourself you wished you would've just paid the extra 50 bucks for the bundle with that memory card
437,thomas p,2022,5,I guess I got lucky getting this!
438,danny james franco,2021,5,So I upgraded from the XBOX one X and I wasn't expecting much from the series X when I got but I was proven wrong. Games look waayy better especially with some games getting Auto HDR. Games also load faster when you transfer them to the internal drive same speeds fast of you use the series X expansion card. The main menu is still the same just more snappier same applies to the xbox store so that's good. Quick resume was a feature I was like ehh sounds good but whatever and I actually use it quiet often then I thought I would. My down side to it is that their isn't any new xbox game yet. If you have an OG xbox upgrade to this when you can and you will be amazed.
439,Nick M.,2022,5,"Product arrived fast, shipped safely, and arrived ahead of time. The power was a significant step up from the previous generation of console and has been well, well worth it."
440,Luke Pham,2022,5,nothing about dislike this entertainment unit. Just power up and enjoy.
441,Nathan R Coffin,2022,5,My Xbox came quick and in perfect condition I couldn't have asked for better
442,Berty Martinez,2020,4,"Have had it for 2 weeks now. Gotta say that it's a pretty cool console. If you have an XONE or OneX you'll feel familiar with the ui since it's basically the same. Now there aren't that many games that scream Next gen yet. Though the upgrades for series x/s optimized games are very cool with more incoming. As it stands, besides things like quick resume(which has it's few issues like not working 100% of the time), faster loading times, this gen is barely starting. So don't fret if you haven't been able to get one yet. Another point with these new consoles (ps5 included) is that in order to play at 4k 120 frames per second you need a tv that has hdmi 2.1. I went with an LG un 65nano85una. Awesome tv and not as pricey as oleds."
443,Jay,2022,5,Great for the whole family.
444,J. Giles,2021,5,"I was fortunate to get this on launch day.  I have grown to absolutely love this system.The fact that all my games came over from the One, including all the BC games made me so happy!The Kinect does not work with the Series X.  This actually makes me sad because I love the Kinect, so it'll just stay on my old XBox One.The future is bright for all the systems.  I'm not a fanboy.  So just enjoy the gaming and be happy we live in the day we live in with this technology.  XBox, PS5, Switch, PC...  Just get them all."
445,1289dude,2022,5,"It's a Series X, what more can I say."
446,KR,2021,4,"Runs quiet, runs fast. Exclusive games are an issue, although not as big of an issue as they were for Xbox a few years ago. The disk drive can be a bit loud while playing a movie or a game, but other than that not much to complain about. Also the 4K video player is not quite on the same level as the PS5s as far as technical prowess, but it's not really noticeable unless you're looking for issues in a direct comparison."
447,Charles lee,2022,5,Item arrived as described and works perfectly.
448,Wes,2022,5,Crazy the performance you can get for $500. My gaming pc was triple the price for the same graphics.
449,Troy,2022,5,So far I like everything about this cancel game console
450,Andrew Frye,2021,4,"If you do manage to get your hands on one of these next gen consoles i would honestly recommend a ps5 over this, a decent system but to me falls short of the ps5 in exclusives so far and just feeling like pushing the pace of next gen consoles"
451,Christopher Quinn,2022,5,And at $500 too
452,Conan,2022,5,It plays the latest games and game pass is a blessing.
453,Tee,2022,5,Excellent
454,Amazon Customer,2022,5,It was actually in stock and showed up as advertised!  That in itself is a win!
455,William Daniels,2022,5,🔥🔥🔥 everything imagined
456,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Excellent gaming console.
457,Jamaal,2022,5,Love everything about this system. So happy I was able to grab one off the last restock.
458,Collin crawford,2022,5,Product came a week early. And it works fine. Couldn’t be happier.
459,Da.Sa.Ol.Po,2022,5,Love it! Glad I got to snag one. Only took 2.5 years.
460,Yoduh,2021,3,"I have had my Series X for a year now and feel I can give a full review finally. The console is just mediocre, the graphics are fine the games are awesome in fact I think Gamepass Ultimate is the best value in gaming right now, I just wish Microsoft had a console that matched it.The audio from the console itself is just silly, unless your TV/Monitor has built in speakers or audio out then you will need to use a HDMI audio extractor, an official wireless headset, or wired headphones connected to the controller, also no bluetooth connections so most modern headsets, and sound systems are useless with this console.The wifi can be very finicky and drops a lot, no other wifi device I have loses connection as much as this console so I have started to use a wired connection.Only 1 USB port in the front is lackluster.This feels like a $300 console not a $500 one."
461,Dan Alexandar,2022,5,"Blazing fast, amazing picture if you have the right display, and Microsoft's ever growing gaming library doesn't suck."
462,sexyknickers,2022,5,Package arrived promptly and safely. Love my new unit.
463,Aaron V,2021,5,"Owned this device for about a month now and was purchased for $499.99 msrp (yes this is possible).  Outstanding improvement over an Xbox one x. Load times are near instant for last gen games. Smart delivery provides a free upgrade for most AAA titles (forza, halo, etc).  60 fps massive improvement over 30. Can't wait to purchase a TV that supports 120 fps.Though the ability to purchase this console right now is limited, it is worth the hype. Don't pay over retail as these devices are coming back in stock more frequently than a year ago. Good luck all potential buyers."
464,gschurman,2022,5,Bought it at MSRP wife is really happy iam happy that we can game together
465,Justice,2022,5,
466,Matthew Smith,2022,5,Great price. Great packaging. Amazing condition and even arrived 2 days early.. well done... well served.
467,Enjoying Life,2022,3,"If you have an Xbox One X, I would suggest you skip this one.  I bought it, expecting it to be ‘so much better’ than my Xbox one X.  Unfortunately I can’t see much difference.  The games my load a little quicker, but that’s about it.Maybe this will be worth it when Microsoft creates some amazing games only for the Xbox Series X, but until then, don’t buy it unless you are still playing on a Xbox 360."
468,Mfroland29,2022,5,My item was delivered on time. The seller kept in touch via email to inform me of the delivery status. The product was as advertised.
469,Efrain,2022,5,loved it
470,MrSavoie2U,2020,4,"This is above and beyond the best Xbox console to date, however there are system updates still needed to improve the overall performance in games. Due to the fact that Microsoft waited for AMD to finalize the RDNA 2 feature set so the Series consoles could have the entire feature set, the system is behind in terms of max performance capabilities. Once these system updates roll out and the system fully utilizes the full RDNA 2 feature set and games are taking full advantage of them, we should see the full potential of the console. Early on there seems to be some slight performance issues with the cross gen titles at least. Still very happy with Xbox and the direction it's going as a gaming platform."
471,Joshua M,2022,5,"I purchased this Xbox series x from Best4Sale. Great Seller, 2 day shipping, item new in box in perfect condition and works great."
472,Melissa.D,2022,5,I'm team playstation all the way but this Xbox went on sale and I decided to get it and I love it. It also came pretty fast.
473,Clarence freeman,2022,5,This product is excellent 👍
474,Patrick Skeith,2022,3,"I have the PS5 as well and both consoles are terrible at 4k gaming, but I would still rate the PS5 higher than the Series X because there are barely and exclusive title that have released to take advantage of the improved hardware… This pains me because I was basically raised on the OG Xbox and Xbox 360 and genuinely love the exclusives of the past.Here’s to hoping that Microsoft puts all those new IPs they bought to good use in the near future!"
475,Amazon Customer,2022,5,its a xbox series x. takes a bit for load times sometimes but eh i won't need to upgrade for a long while
476,Kendricks Baldwin,2022,5,If you  want a xbox series x or xbox series s Ef deals  is the best and they deliver fast too.
477,B. Newell Tech And Brand Rep,2022,5,Hope y’all get one soon… for cost of course.
478,Robert Riddle,2022,5,Great!!
479,TBird,2022,5,It’s perfect I love it and have never used anything with that much power thank you so much!
480,mam319,2022,5,Came in just like it said it would! Mint condition and unopened!
481,Zach,2022,5,fastest I've ever gotten a package. ordered eating lunch at noon and got it at 4 same day. perfect condition
482,Sebastian,2021,5,"technically a superior machine to the PS5, the impressive hardware means nothing without a variety of games that take advantage of it. whereas the ps5 launched with miles morales and demons souls and a few others, microsoft has merely optimized some titles for their new generation. as an owner of both the ps5 and the xbox series x i can assure if you can only get one, get the ps5. there are better games on it and that trend will continue, even with microsoft acquiring bethesda.the console itself is impressive, but falls short due to a lack of games, which is what this machine is all about."
483,Altoh khadka,2021,5,"I been hunting for these xbox for almost 4 months now . Sleepless night , countless try , countless store visits , filled . Amazon made my life much better . Process of buying this product was very easy and fast . Shipping was very fast as well.Xbox itself is a the best ever , xbox taken over I think with this console . The packing to its design I love it all.I am on my 4th week I think and already have over 100+ hours into it and I love every moment ..Respond time is great , is fastest ever , processing is awesome . Would recommend this to anyone ......"
484,Carolina Arango,2022,5,I play gears of war with this and the graphics are amazing
485,Jerry Robbins,2022,5,It’s an amazing Xbox and is seriously worth the wait.
486,Zack winter,2022,5,I love it best graphics on my 4k tv
487,Danny,2022,5,Excellent service and product came just as promoted 👍
488,Wayne Aung,2021,5,I got lucky and was able to get it for retail. My son loves it and he said it is the best Christmas gift he ever had. Image quality is amazing and gameplay is incredibly smooth. I wish they could include extra controller but it's ok since I got one for a great deal during black friday.
489,Abdul Newland,2022,5,Best system hands down
490,Dan,2022,5,Love the system graphics are great
491,Desaraye McCue,2022,5,This arrived really fast. The graphics are so sharp and crisp. I’m very happy with the system. Long time Xbox fan.
492,Edsel Talbert,2022,5,Unit was shipped to me brand new in pristine condition well protected. You can trust this seller.
493,Kolby,2021,5,"I've had this console for 3 months now and it is awesome. I can load large games like Forza Horizon 4 and Vahalla in 5-7 seconds. Plus, the quick resume is crazy impressive. For example, I started Halo MCC after 2 WEEKS of not playing it and it picked up in a campaign mission right where I left off!!! The console is very quiet. Graphics are super sexy, I highly recommend getting a TV that can take advantage of the 4K at 120fps. The new controller is comfortable with a better texture grip and d-pad. Overall, this is the best gaming console ever built. The Microsoft UI is streamlined and super user friendly as well."
494,JT,2022,5,"It processes so well, and is so good for playing fps games or really any game."
495,Barbara Lewis,2022,5,
496,Stephen Morley,2020,5,"It’s a behemoth simple put. Besides that it is a really amazing console. Just setting it up and downloading a few games for my son, I could really notice the download speed and performance upgrades. Does not run hot so far it has been running terratech in 4K hdr for about half hour. See picture. The Xbox one x would easily hit 150 degrees Fahrenheit."
497,Amazon Customer,2022,5,This is a wonderful console. Arrived perfectly fine. Console works great and stock has met demand. Good job xbox!
498,Dustin,2022,5,First xbox ever owned. Love it!
499,niuvis,2020,5,"This consoles amazing, straight up beast runs games at 60 fps at 4k most of the time. There are still not games enchanted for this but even then HDR comes in and makes them look beautiful either way. The heat on the console is not as bad as I thought it is when you put your hand on it but thats fine. I'm proud with this product and Amazon got it on time. Now let me tell you that if you have an Xbox one x I would wait a while, even though this is a beast it does not come with any exclusively so if your just wanting it for something new don't expect to be blown away."
500,David,2021,5,"I would advice people just wait for restocks, keep coming back to Amazon to check if they have any inventory because of high demand it will be hard.. but keep trying and do not pay scalpers more than you have to. I got mine today 2/14/2020 from Amazon, super fast shipping and paid 499+tax in New York, patience is key.So far enjoying it, the UI could be more ""next gen"" but it's also cool to use it because you already know it from the Xbox One UI.I will update this review as my experience evolve with the console.DO NOT PAY MORE THAN 499+tax"
501,Nick Miller,2022,5,Super powered console. Game pass is the best value in gaming. Period.
502,Rebecca Barner,2022,5,I just love it!
503,Seth Vanderkar,2022,5,I’ve had so much fun with this console since I got it.
504,Tom,2022,5,Finally got one that wasn't a bundle or being scalped by someone with a bot program.
505,J. Sanders,2022,5,Amazing
506,Luis Angel Cerda-Izucar,2022,5,everything loads so much faster and runs smoothly
507,Trevor D.,2020,5,"The new Series X is absolutely amazing. It's super fast and responsive, makes everything look better on a 4k TV (even non-120Hz tv's), and was SUPER EASY TO SET UP via the Xbox app. Even progressing from the One X, it is very easy to see the difference. It's larger than I expected, but still fits nicely among the atmosphere. The quick resume feature lives up to its name, and I highly recommend it for anybody looking to upgrade their current Xbox experience.For those that were unfortunate enough to get screwed out of launch day pre-order, it is absolutely worth the struggle and frustration.Can't recommend enough! Just don't vape into it."
508,Whiskeyjd,2022,5,Loads games really fast. Great graphics!!!
509,Vikas Sivaravindran,2022,5,Great product ! Worth the price.
510,Patrick,2022,5,Overall great console! Came the next day from when I ordered it. It is pretty bulky and can take up space in your tv cabinet or stand so be aware of that.
511,Nicholas Calderone,2021,5,Saying it was hard to get a hold of is an understatement. Saying it's just ok would be a lie. I love my new Xbox and when I was able to get one ordered I was bouncing off the walls. The new Xbox has some real power and the graphics have been fantastic. I am a real Xbox fanboy but the new machine did not make that hard. It is for sure one of my favorite buys of the year.
512,Dean R. ,2021,5,"Quality is the best! Is the most powerful next gen console currently out right now! I don’t like how the used the same old last gen display interface but that’s okay, I have the ps5 as well and the quality on the Xbox is a lot better! Especially when u play call of duty warzone online, huge difference in input lag because the Xbox provides a easier backward compatibility updater  because of its design. The Ps5 on the other hand struggles with updating backward compatibile games. They either have input lags or are chopping at times. Xbox truly shows it’s power! 5 out of 5"
513,KrisTK,2022,5,"The most current model, as described. In perfect condition on arrival. Very happy."
514,Bradley,2021,4,It’s legit. The system is great definitely get one. It’s a night and day difference from my old Xbox one s. Load times are so fast that it’s honestly ridiculous.I gave 4/5 stars because I disagree in the extra $365 that got from me but whatever
515,Dylan Musick,2021,4,"It’s great if you don’t wanna wait till they come back in stock. A bit pricey, but this is actually the cheapest and most reliable seller to get a Series X from right now. I love my Series X and to me it was worth the money 100%."
516,Jeremy Dees,2021,5,"I was so excited when I ordered this at the end of last year and even more excited when I received it.I've put tons of hours into it so far and I can say, the load times are as good as people say, and the graphics are nothing to scoff at either.The only real issue I have with it is more of a non-issue I guess? But if you have a TV that is HDR you will want to make doubly sure it is HDR10+ otherwise the Series X will not activate HDR."
517,Brian Thompson,2022,5,The best next gen console!
518,Amazon Customer,2022,3,"Product works just fine with no damage other than the box itself, which wasn't in an Amazon box. When I plugged it in, it didn't need setting up and already had an account, not mine, on it. I suggest you skip Amazon and buy somewhere in store. Not like I can return this one when there isn't a supply yo replace it with."
519,Ron,2021,5,"Got one of these for my son... he has the PS5 as well... don’t c a huge difference in the 2 myself but maybe because I’m an observer and not a gamer any longer... but I def have plenty of experience playing video games... actually have had two game induced seizures from extended play (20 & 25 hours straight) so it’s not like I’m unfamiliar... all in all great system... size, speed, cost, graphics etc. r all fine by me... hope u enjoy yours if u elect 2 u get it..."
520,MJ,2022,5,I got mine for $648 dollars and it was legit one not those consoles that have issues and its very quiet even i played disc games. 5 🌟
521,HiTechKoolAid,2020,5,"I know most people will say there is no reason to upgrade at this time due to no exclusive content, but the loading times alone were worth it.  Borderlands 3 loading times are like 4 times faster.  Game loads in around 1 minute compared to 5 and fast travels are around 13 seconds compared to 1 minute.  Think of how much time people wasted farming on the Xbox One due to those horrendous loading times.  As they say ""Time is Money"" and this system will definitely save you time so you can do other things instead of wasting it on loading screens."
522,Zach B,2021,5,"Finally got one!!!!! Thank you amazon!!! Ordered it FEB 12th, came Feb 14th. Happy valentines day to me!! The xbsx is so worth the hype. The graphics and buttery smooth motion fluidity are amazing. Quick resume is an option on a console I never thought wed have.. No bulky power supply cord! Its internal, so just a slim wire that goes from your xbox to the wall. Just like a tv!! I love it and cant believe i got it within 2 days!! People ordered theirs from Walmart a few weeks ago and still haven't gotten it yet."
523,nina thomas,2022,2,I didn't receive a booklet with this and the packaging was tore to pieces. Seems to be working fine tho!
524,Yoan,2022,5,Excelente artículo
525,Maria Leverson,2022,2,"This system has constant issues with not connecting to the internet, even though self test says the internet is available, difficulty logging on even though I am the sole user, It requires delving into the system to discover that updates are required to start up.Game specific issues with Destiny 2 are also constant, parental control warnings, inability to connect to the server (although my PS4 has no such issues) and the Xbox headset fails to connect which requires a system reboot which leads to failures to connect to the internet, parental control notices etc...I give it a two star rating because when it does run properly it is quite nice, which is only around 70-80% of the time."
526,Wendy Clemente Griffin,2022,5,It came all together and no problems:)
527,Dennis Rodriguez,2022,5,Fastest Console
528,Javi1223,2022,5,Best upgrade
529,Jerry McKinniss,2022,5,Blown away. More than I expected !
530,Hendrik,2022,5,nice console I love it
531,Andrew,2020,5,"I am a PC gamer but when the Series X was announced I was going to pre-order.Console is great, well made and looks cool.Gameplay is honestly amazing at 4K. Some games run just as well if not better than my gaming rig PC, and I have a pretty solid PC.The controller is great and improved over an already really good controller design. The reach is much further than the gen 2 Xbox one controllers and the share button is great.I highly recommend this system to anyone. Having Gamepass ultimate with EA games included is an unreal value."
532,Jeo99433,2021,5,It’s an awesome console. I was thankful I bought when Amazon didn’t post the news about the restock I just guess it. But I really hope others can get it to without worrying about the scalpers. Please Amazon talk to other retails and console companies to be strict with purchasing these consoles. I purchase the series x and 2 s for my kids so don’t let me buy more also bought 2 ps5 so don’t need to buy another just need to add warranty in case.
533,Betulia García Posadas,2022,5,Muy Buen Produnto Confiable y Duradero.
534,Joel Rosario Santana,2022,5,Excelente
535,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Awesome!
536,Tyrone Perry,2022,5,Gaming fast and wonderful experience
537,IrisL,2021,5,"Got this way before the date when it was suppose to arrive. I am super happy. I got to flex with this in 2020. I was upgrading from the OG XBOX so everything made me happy. Love how the controllers felt, love how fast it loads regardless if it’s quick resume title even the apps/going into settings it’s just so fast. HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING A SERIES X if you can’t get a PC with a Nvidia RTX3000 series or AMD RX6000 series"
538,Kindle Customer,2020,5,"I lucked out and saw an article on the web that Amazon had a limited number of Xbox x Series. I went to Amazon and wow, it was still not sold out. It did about an hour later when I checked. So I lucked out. But the machine is amazing. That is not hyperbole. Borderlands 3 took close to 4-5 minutes opening on my Xbox One X. This machine takes about 10 seconds! from opening the game to playing. The games themselves run as smooth as butter no lag and stuttering on multiplayer games. Love it."
539,C. Yost,2021,5,"It's friggin' amazing.I paid an extra $200 to scalpers (so, $700) and I'm happy with the outcome.If you can snag it for $500? GET IT!I've never been happier choosing something else over a girlfriend!"
540,Chapo chavez,2021,5,"I got the hookups from my guy Escoboy17, he got the sauce and was able to get me an esbos. It's great, I use it to play Halo and GTA. Very happy Christmas!"
541,Luis Fabian,2022,3,No me gusto que el producto no llego en la fecha que debió llegar pero después de eso todo bien
542,Jesse W.,2020,5,"I noticed the two reviews for this console are people that were upset that they didn't get one. Hopefully Amazon will remove these. I have purchased the Series X, and am very happy with what I got. The loading times are great, the games look and play great, and the console is super quiet. If you have Game Pass, you can't go wrong with this purchase, and if you don't, you should get Game Pass. It really is a great console, and I can't wait to see what games will be coming out for it in the future."
543,Arizona,2022,5,Also the condition was perfect.
544,Frank Gibson,2022,1,"This thing is total junk.Missing the usb cable so there is no way to charge the controller. Can't do anything with a controller that has no power.The game that comes with the system, where you just repeatedly tell it to try the wired Ethernet connection again and again is just dumb and boring. After two hours of playing that, it was ready to ask for my email address, but then told me that I am already using my email address so I must make a new one. Then it tells me that it will sell all of my information to everyone. Two days in and it tells me that it wants me to pick a color that will make this unique and mine, but then limits me to only a few colors. Then, no mater what color I pick, the thing just stays the same black cheap plastic color. it's going in the fire."
545,Colton Aske,2022,5,It works really good thank you
546,Derek Givens,2021,5,"Love the console. Super fast and quiet. Please avoid the scalper prices! Shout out to Amazon for making sure I got my system. They were selling out just as I placed my order and the nearest Amazon warehouse near me was out of them. Amazon made arrangements to get another one shipped from a NJ warehouse to Pittsburgh and then to me. I took almost 2 weeks to get, but they compensated me for the wait period. I am very happy with the console and service!"
547,Yuri Vergara,2021,4,"Gráficos, velocidad muy buenos.No se que pasa pero los videojuegos en español de repente se pasan a ingles.Gears Of War 5 en ocasiones el sonido de entrecortaba. Solo se soluciona reiniciando la consola."
548,Amazon Customer,2021,4,"Works very good, over priced but worth it. Only issue I have with it is that it gets hot very fast. I put a fan right next to it so it’s not as bad"
549,Tim,2022,5,Great product. Got exactly what was advertised.
550,darrell,2022,5,Yes
551,Vinod,2020,5,"I've never been so blown away by a console before, this system truly delivers on what Microsoft promised. Although there aren't many games that can truly take advantage of the hardware performance the series x offers, the games that are x/s enhanced are otherworldly. Silky smooth 4k HDR at 120fps is gorgeous and I'll never go back. And it's soooooo quiet! Quick resume and transfer speeds from/to the seagate drive are a game changer. I transferred 100 Gb in 3 minutes. Crazy! I'm so happy with this console and can't wait for the next generation of gaming!"
552,Sean Brett,2022,5,
553,Anthony,2021,5,"Was expensive but very much worth it! I bought this and it came on the exact day it said it will come and when it came, it was perfect, no damages and no bad reputations. The console works perfect because it is brand new and so i trust this company and you should too."
554,PAtty,2022,1,"UPDATE 2: Alright so I found a way around having the internet to play the games. However, when you buy a disc for the first time and pop it in, you have to be online to register the game license. Then and only then can you play it offline.Listen, this is a great system. This console IMO is made for online gaming as Xbox Gamepass gives you the best bang for your buck. The Home Screen when you turn this console on is all about online playing, discounts for pass, etc....For an old gamer like myself, this is not for me. For the new generation, I will concede this is a must have. I will return to my PS3-PS4. When I am done, I will probably gravitate towards PC.Thankfully, Amazon allows me to return this. Happy gaming to everyone, and if you are not an old fart like me, you can disregard this review.UPDATE 1: I received my Xbox series X last 1 week, played for two days (made the jump from Playstation).Beware, if you purchased any digital copy games or have a disc games, you HAVE TO HAVE INTERNET CONNECTION in order to play the games offline.This system is unplayable without internet."
555,Donta,2020,5,"First off I’d like to say the console has been awesome since I’ve received it. I ordered to receive day one but did end up receiving 3 days afterwards which was fine with me... kinda. Installing the system to my setup was easy. Very smooth and great graphics. Definetly excited for the long haul.Few bad things I’ve noticed with Bluetooth issues with my headset and controller. They will only reconnect with I hard reset the console, a slight burning plastic smell but that’s been slowly going away, only bad things I noticed really lol"
556,Chelsea,2022,2,First day started having connection issues disconnecting from the 5g internet. Tested the other xb1 and xb1 x and they have never and continue to not have this issue. The series x kicks me out of games every 10minutes to half hour. It loads very slow and trying to look at games on the store is impossible
557,Lycanroc,2021,4,"Xbox One titles run buttery smooth and hopefully Microsoft will be adding FPS Boost to a LOT more titles that run at 30 fps. If you need to wait out the GPU shortage, then the Series X + Game Pass is the way to go!Also, do NOT buy from scalpers! Let their inventory rot!"
558,Jay,2022,5,Fantastic
559,Marvin Stinson,2021,4,Arrived two days later than stated but all was in good shape and working fine.
560,Raul,2021,5,"It's a console for games and movies, TV features gone like watching cable tv  but still so much power to do wonders, a streamer of opportunities, I'm amazed how a machine like this can do so much and with F1 lighting speed, so worth every cent, so glad to have made a great buy, thank you"
561,Joel Velez,2021,5,"This is my first Xbox experience ever and I'm loving it. Quick resume is mind blowing good. UI it's fast, snappy and easy to navigate. Console is silent, even more than the PS5. The only downside it's that I wish it had more next gen titles at launch. Since I'm an Xbox ""newbie"" I have a lot of catch up to do gaming wise, so it's not that bad. Can't wait to see what developers come up with in the future. Really exciting stuff."
562,SKY,2020,5,"The product is top notch. I am able to use all my Xbox One accessories on it. The load times are very fast. The system itself is very quiet. The step up from my previous Xbox is amazing. I highly recommend this product. The quality is amazing with 4K up to 120FPS (my tv is capped at 4K and 60 FPS, until I buy a 120hz tv/monitor). In person the console looks very sleek as well. I could go on for a while, it is everything you want in a console and more."
563,JT,2021,4,"More care could have went to packaging (i.e. taping OEM box close after inspection) as shipments are usually tossed around from agents. Otherwise, arrived as described."
564,Cory A,2021,5,"Everything we expected from the next generation gaming consoles. 60-120fps gaming in top resolution is incredible the first time you experience it. Software optimization is still catching up, but this 'box vastly outperforms gaming PC setups achieved at the same price point (it's not remotely close). Allows utilization of the best TVs/displays & the best subscription service in gaming. Overall, an impressive product from Microsoft."
565,Rylan Whan,2021,4,The speed from one x to series x is at least double. Load times are halved at worst for most games. The price may not be worth it unless you want faster load times and true 4k gaming.
566,Mr. Miller,2022,5,Good Product
567,Sage,2020,4,"First off I just want to say that I love everything about this console. The controller, the load times, the graphics, the UI, everything. My main issue is that, Microsoft offers a lot of games in Games with Gold and Game Pass and the issue im having is that I dont have enough storage for the games that I want. I wish there were 2T versions, but I will deal with it until I can scrap together another $100 for a 4T Seagate."
568,justin skultka,2020,5,So somehow the other day I was on Amazon and I was able to buy an Xbox that was here in under a week!!! It is for my son for Xmas I definitely should have bought more than the one .I was so excited to actually even buy one though! One thing that sucks is amazon uses ups sometimes for shipping I’ve had two things in the last month take longer than expected. Overall definitely excited to give my som an Xbox for Christmas!!!!
569,leslie,2021,5,Product was in the box. Showed up way sooner than expected. It was for my husband's birthday so when the box showed up he grabbed it and I told him it was drinking glasses and to becareful lol he was shocked when he seen it and didn't believe it until he started playing on it. Love it. Only place to find it
570,mister,2021,5,I am VERY happy with the performance of this console compared to my old One X. I actually enjoy playing on this console to the point where I dont feel like its a downgrade anymore when I am not on my gaming PC. The load times are great and if you have gamepass this is a must.I am using an external 3TB HDD for the non optimized games and everything works perfectly.
571,Trey R.,2021,5,"This package still had the factory stickers on the outside of the box. I received this much sooner than anticipated. With all the scams surrounding the next generation consoles, I admit I was worried. The seller answered my questions abruptly, shipped out immediately, and was properly secured inside the shipping box. The only issue I had was with FedEx. I would gladly buy from this seller again."
572,Andrew,2022,5,Goat console
573,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Husband loves it
574,ChristFire!,2020,5,"Absolutely Incredible Console with Amazing Graphics, Super High Build Quality, etc as I can’t say enough Awesome Stuff About The New Xbox Series X as it’s Like Having A True High End Gaming Pc without the associated Price Tag since We Get The Entire Xbox Series X for only $499 which is what an equivalent 3070/6800 GPU alone by itself would cost of which Pc gamers would easily spend $1600 dollar’s to build a Pc to match the Specs, and performance capabilities of the Series X"
575,Lewis O. Paddock,2022,5,Gaming
576,Sam,2020,5,"I love it, never going back to Playstation. I have only ever owned Nintendo and Sony until this generation, but I have had it with Sony's BS. I was lucky enough to get a Series X pre order and I could not be happier. All my friends are jealous and the ones that had Playstation 4s are now switching back to Xbox after seeing this in person. Blind brand loyalty aside, this is the greatest console of this generation hands down."
577,Fr. J. J. Batcha,2021,4,I do not like that it would not connect at First to our wifi. It still has some glitches display through my HDMI switch.
578,Theta Chi Clayton HB,2021,5,"4k at 120 fps is beautiful! I wish they had a limited edition at launch, but will upgrade more than likely on the mid refresh if they up the storage. Before all the PC fanboys get their feeling hurt, I have a PC with a 3080, that is more productive for mining than gaming, so I know what I bought with this."
579,Roman Anthony Flores Jr,2020,5,"The Xbox Series X is a very fast console and great upgrade from my previous Xbox One (day one console). If you’re looking to get the same experience from last Gen but upgraded, this console is definitely a huge upgrade. You can still talk to people from other Xbox One consoles.You’re paying for the quick resume feature, extremely fast load times, & the 144 hz and 4K experience. (Not every game can run at 144z and 4K yet)"
580,Greg & Kristen M.,2021,5,"If you do, this is the thing to buy! They want to play it non-stop. The graphics and performance are fantastic. Build quality is rock solid. Controllers are great. To top that off, it makes it CRAZY easy for your kids to buy more games without bugging you for a credit card. Who doesn't want that?!  You want 5 minutes to take a dump in peace, buy this monolith. You'll thank me later."
581,Ivan,2021,5,By far the best Xbox has to offer nothing else compares especially with a gamepass subscription you'll never have trouble finding something to play.
582,Mandy,2021,5,Easy to set up and transfer account and games. My one complaint is that it gets hot pretty quick. Needs to be in an open area foor cooling. I had it setup in my cubby hole just like the xbox one but this one got so hot after a couple of rounds of COD that I could smell the plastic burning.
583,Mike Richardson,2021,5,"So far i'm loving the series x a lot! I've had it for about a month now and i've had no problems, no crashes, it's super quiet when playing both digital and disc games, and overall i'm loving it! Graphics and gameplay is super clean and smooth, and really feels better than playing on the Xbox One. Definitely worth the purchase in my opinion if you're thinking about buying one."
584,Jacobo Trogler,2022,5,Def worth it! I’ve been playing Halo Infinite non stop.
585,Jon,2021,4,"I got the console, cords and controller but it wasn’t in a actual Xbox box but the other pictures I saw they did"
586,Real_Sgt_Tom,2020,5,The most powerful console just got upgraded again to the new most powerful console in my house thanks to this beast of a tower of power. It starts up so quick and older games work even better right out of the box with no updates needed. The Quick Resume feature is probably the most ground breaking thing in gaming not being talked about to this point. It will be even bigger of a story next year and thereafter!
587,Aleesha Younker,2022,5,Blends in well with my other electronics. Love it.
588,Michael A,2020,5,It's everything that I expected..with the game pass it's the console to get..may not have any new 1st party titles at launch but with the game pass and alot of the games like gears 5 and forza horizon 4 getting 4k upgrades then it's absolutely worth the buy. The series X is also extremely quiet...all that power in a little box that sounds that quiet is hard to believe but xbox did it..microsoft definitely did everything right this generation.
589,Matthew Santana,2022,5,"My package was delivered promptly, and was exactly as described. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
590,BlueHeelered,2021,5,"Despite not having many next gen titles available to show off the series X tech, this was still a good purchase.  I have found the playing on older games is excellent and this alone justifies the purchase.  The older games run smoother, load faster and look better if optimized.  I'm quite happy."
591,Jon,2021,5,"Been trying to find this for sale since its release date. Paid a little extra but, sooo worth it! This thing is a beast! 1,000x better than the last Xbox! Had an issue getting the controller linked at first but, got it to work. Otherwise, no issues so far! I absolutely love it!"
592,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Great packaging.  Came early.  Works great.
593,Dababy,2022,2,Whenever I play online games 2k fort apex etc it lags so much and just lags me out the game and if anyone knows how to fix it please help
594,anonymous customer,2021,5,"It's my first gaming console and I have been a PC guy for a long time. But this console makes me realize why we game in the first place. The convenience of playing on a couch, instant start up, and quick switch between games is the killer over PC. I have xgpu as well and it saves a ton of money. Cannot wait for the incoming first-party games."
595,Keven Sanchez,2022,5,great console for my kids! they enjoyed it for winter break!
596,Kindle Customer,2021,4,The series x is a super fast machine however the thing didn’t power up two weeks after I got and had to send it in and be careful because Microsoft only gives a 30-45 day warranty on a 500$ item which is garbage that is why it doesn’t get 5 stars
597,jpot,2020,4,Exclusives aren’t there yet but the game pass ultimate subscription is a great value as had different games to try out.  Loading is a lot quicker too.My only complaint would be the guide is exactly the same and the controller feels identical which sucks as it doesn’t feel like a next gen but a refresh.  Wish they would have revamped both like sony did
598,Ruby Styr,2022,5,"XBOX X is so good! It has been awesome, and love the fast Amazon delivery!"
599,Cole,2020,5,"Having owned all but one Xbox generation on release day, I can honestly say that the Series X feels far more finished than the 360 or One did at launch. Everything works as intended. The UI, although not shiny and new, works flawlessly. The graphics are awesome, it’s quiet, it runs cooler than its predecessor, and load times are a fraction of what they used to me. I might be in love with a gaming console."
600,MrEWhite,2020,5,"Compared to the One X, this is a great upgrade. Some games that had slow downs (such as COD MW) are completely smooth on here. I also really like the controller, because, even compared to the Elite Series 2, the thumbsticks are better. I also like the expansion port over what the PS5 has, which is a much simpler card solution when compared to the M.2 SSD slot on the PS5 (which isn't even active at launch)."
601,Blake J.,2021,5,Xbox series x is a strong performing device for only 500 bucks. Good deal if you can get one .
602,Davids2ndSon,2021,5,"Xbox Series X, quieter than a whisper, faster than a bullet. True 4K at 60fps gaming. Arrived one week after public release date. Have been using it everyday and not any issues with it. Best console I've ever owned. Even downloads at a faster rate than what I pay my ISP for. Very happy. Highly recommend for serious gamers."
603,Adam M,2021,5,The Xbox Series X is so far an awesome product. The load times are fast and the graphics are amazing. Overall the Series X is an awesome product and the shipping for me was faster than expected. I received my console days earlier than the expected delivery date.
604,Andy,2022,5,Other than being hard to get I thought this was an excellent console with great gameplay.
605,LJ,2020,4,Xbox has finally perfected building a great console now it needs to work on getting some games out for that great console. If you have an xbox one x I would highly recommend waiting until they start releasing more games as there just isnt enough to play for next gen games that justify paying $500+. No complaints with the hardware though.
606,Julian Fukue,2021,4,"I would honestly wait a little before rushing to get one. There aren't enough release titles, and isn't really worth the upgrade just yet since you'll be stuck playing last gen games on it for a while. If you had a choice, I'd go with a PS5 with the better controllers anyhow."
607,Mateo Rodríguez,2021,5,What an absolute beautiful and powerful piece of tech. I'm not gonna miss my One X :)
608,Sophie ,2020,5,"I like it so far it works really well with my 4K tv a bought, once I compared the graphics to my Xbox one to this...I definitely see a big difference. The only down side is it’s really lacking in new and exciting games. Obviously we all know ps5 really our does Xbox with games, but if you’re a loyal Xbox gamer this is definitely a step up from the last console."
609,Morgan,2021,5,"It's fast, the hype is real.  Loads games in half to a quarter of the time quicker.  All the games look amazing, and the quick resume is awesome as well.  Just an overall great machine.  Glad I was able to finally get one."
610,F0URTYK,2020,5,"Do you actually need this review? No, you don't. You know if you are buying this or not, idk why you even scrolled down. If you are reading this then:1. The console is still out of stock and you are teasing yourself by looking at the listingOR2. It is back in stock and you are reading this review as it goes back out of stock. Good job wasting time."
611,Steve,2020,5,"This is a marvel of technological engineering. Graphics are amazing, the fan is virtually silent, Microsoft game pass is far and away the best value in gaming, controller feels like an extension of my hand. I have no regrets about this purchase 10/10 I'm having the most fun gaming I've ever had on this thing and I've been a player since NES.Do yourself a favor and buy this as soon as possible"
612,Brittney C.,2022,5,"came in perfect condition and original packaging , never opened, absolutely amazing!"
613,TheDude,2022,1,"I just want to start by saying I do not own a 4k TV, and I would not buy this console unless you own a 4k TV.  I dont know how much better the picture quality will be on a 4k TV, I would hope much much better but I think its garbage and a waste of money.  With that said I do have a really nice flat screen TV, and the picture quality absolutely sucks.  I mean complete garbage.  Specially for paying $499.99.  Theres not many games for the series X either.  I have the game pass and its mostly xbox 360 games.  Its like i bought the series x just to play 360 games.  Anyways I'm Returning it."
614,Brandon Dominguez,2020,5,"The Xbox Series X is amazing. Everything is very fast, games load faster, every game is at least 60 FPS, and some games such as Grand Theft Auto 5 are 4K. Games also download much faster, I currently download at 380 Mbps when it used to be 120 Mbps on my Xbox One X. Before I couldn’t play Modern Warfare, now I play with no lag, at a smooth consistent frame rate."
615,james,2021,5,"The console does many things that make it feel next gen. This specific one is not mine but for a friend. But since owing it since launch day in November, I had no real problems other than crashes and the Bluetooth problem with controller. Overall 10/10 experience with both consoles. Now all we need is next gen games that showcases it's power."
616,David crane,2021,4,"Absolutely amazing but a bit overpriced, but that's what you get when you have to get it early like I did. I got it earlier than most. There are some who might even still be waiting. I also got it a week before they said it would be delivered that's Amazon."
617,Katelyn,2021,5,"The Xbox was indeed new and not opened. Seller Shipped fast, and the xbox works great. My husbands been wanting it for so long but as everyone knows, it's never restocked. Yes the price sucks, but it's to be expected."
618,Devin Nottingham,2021,5,Very capable. When paired with Game Pass this is easily the best value in gaming.
619,DisneyMom,2021,5,Most powerful console mixed with gamepass makes xbox the best place to game this gen
620,Nick,2022,5,"nice system, very fast and graphics are good"
621,Hui,2022,5,"easy to set up, halo is the best game of the year"
622,Jason G,2021,4,I pre-ordered the series x and it was delivered to me a few days after release. The delivery itself was good. No damage to box. Xbox is a great machine with specs that won't be truly harnessed for at least a year. So no hurry on this generation as it's mostly convenience upgrades.
623,Kai,2021,5,Really love how great the xbox x is. It is able to do everything I want it to.
624,Anthony,2020,5,"Great console, easy to set up (it's fast if you use the Xbox App didn't try the other normal way). If you're an everyday Xbox player, once set up, everything is familiar and ready to go. Truly feels like a PC upgrade more than a console upgrade with how smooth everything is.Also don't buy from scalpers, just wait, you're not missing anything even remotely worth the price they are charging."
625,Sam Bransten,2021,5,My cousin was maybe the happiest kid on the block this christmas
626,Jack,2022,2,
627,Nick,2022,5,"not bad product, ps5 is better for me"
628,Restockplease,2021,5,Super lucky to get the product considering how fast it sells out. Would def recommend this to others.
629,Maria Gomez,2021,4,I purchased this item as a gift for my brother and I was a little disappointed when it arrived because one of the sides of the box was ripped but overall the box was still sealed so he still opened it and everything worked perfectly.
630,Ameer Alghabra,2020,5,"This console is absolutely amazing. The lid first thing you notice when you boot it up are the smooth, crisp, and fast load times. The graphics are  on par with a high end PC in the optimized games. The console itself is beautiful. It is very modernistic and blends in well with it’s environment. I have not encountered any errors with it yet!"
631,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Preordered September 22nd. Received package on launch day.This console is amazing. You’ve never experienced load times as fast as the Series X on any other console. The 4K HDR at 120hz is insane.The games can only get better from here. I’ve had no problem with my Xbox and highly praise it.Don’t buy from the scalpers. Be patient. Buy it at MSRP.
632,James Derry,2021,4,"Its expensive but given the limit available, it's worth it. It works. I'm happy with mine."
633,Elisa Bravo,2020,4,The thing I love most about it is the design. It did an amazing job compared to the PS5. Not to mention it's better sized. It is so architectural and minimalist. Mad brutalism/Kaaba vibes. The controller could have been designed better tho. Still has the primary colored buttons which takes away from the black-on-black aesthetic.
634,Fernando Soto,2022,5,
635,Wendy luna,2022,5,Loved it
636,Kevin S.,2020,5,While people are right to point out that there arent a ton of next gen games yet already this thing feels so much faster than the ps4 i had and that was a great console.  Also yes this thing is a utilitarian brick but its smaller than you think it is (compared to ps5 especially) and blends in nicely with your existing entertainment setup.
637,Beard,2020,5,"Best xbox yet. Ignore the haters who can't get one. Everything loads insanely fast and the quick resume feature is amazing. Games just waiting in the background to resume. No wait times after it's loaded. Saves so much time and that's something you have less and less of as you get older and have kids. If you can find one, buy it!"
638,Travis,2021,5,"Due to server issues, I couldn't get ahold of a Series X at launch. Thankfully, I was able to find one with the help of Zoolert. Loading times are quick. As time goes on, and more of the RDNA 2 features are enabled, games will only get better. Great time to be a gamer!"
639,Ritz,2021,5,Received in new condition. Paid $800 after tax. Box had a few little dents but nothing that worried me.  System runs fantastic and no issues after a week. Will buy from them again in the future. Would like to see more padding in the box.
640,William Broad,2021,4,"Unit was well packaged and arrived in a timely manner and was still factory sealed, very pleased with purchase"
641,Son of DeBeech,2022,5,Converted me from the PS world. Absolutely amazing system.
642,Nikesh Patel,2021,5,"Lucky enough to snag one when in stock. With game pass, it's the perfect console to have in the living room. Can use my old Xbox one in a different room and play the same save/continue progress for some games, all in a different room."
643,Sabir Kishore,2021,4,"Does almost everything I expect of it. Except ARk crashes it consistently, sad for a 6 yr old game. Microsoft could have given us 2tb. 1tb fills up way too quickly with the mass of most games worth playing."
644,Amy W.,2021,5,Awesome item. These are hard to get right now. I happened to look one night and a seller had one left. I went ahead with the purchase and am glad I did. My husband and son were very happy. It came in original packaging. No issues at all. It was sold by r-view.
645,Drfemi365,2022,5,Great product
646,Tucker,2021,5,"The price was hars to swallo, if it was not for my amazon gift cards would not have bought. Over all happy though"
647,Stefan,2021,5,"Smart Delivery and the upgrades to older games are amazing on the Series X. I use it so much more than my PS5, because of all the games on Gamepass and replaying all my older titles at 4K 60FPS."
648,lucas,2021,5,"I love this thing, M28U is the cheapest 144 hz 4k monitor with HDMI 2.1 you can get for this and it works great"
649,Tate,2020,4,"The xbox series x works great, but has a few bugs. For example, sometimes the xbox simply refuse to turn off unless you take out the batteries from the controller, because it keep turning the console back on automatically. I might have a ghost or something though so that might be it."
650,Kristin N,2021,5,"What can I say,  best of the best"
651,Jae K.,2021,5,"I just got this today. I was worried that I could have been paying for a used one marked as new, so this review is just to say that it is new and arrived as advertised.I will update if I run into any issues."
652,Marco P.,2021,5,Finally able to get one for retail one year after its originally release
653,Christopher Engler,2021,5,"Great. I chose it over ps5 as I was simply able to purchase the Xbox easier !!! Dalark direct - Thank you guys. It came the next day lol when said would take 5 days or so, they sent it from only a 2 hour drive away.  Thanks Dalark direct!!"
654,Mann,2021,5,"This thing is the real deal! After long time I finally got my hands on one. Boy am I pleased! Everyone says that the ps5 is better but I have no complaints with the Xbox series x. If you can get your hands on one, do not hesitate"
655,Ira Hess,2021,4,"Great buy, there are hot spots issues, but I’d say that’s the biggest issue"
656,Reza,2021,4,"So I have been waiting to get one but it was hard to catch one and I mean literally, all the consoles just vanishes within minutes. But finally got one and I am happy so far no problems whatsoever 😁👍 cheers"
657,Megann Santucci,2022,5,Buy one!
658,Cyrus S.,2021,5,Took a chance on a new seller. Ordered the product late at night. He created the label first thing in the morning and then shipped the product out promptly. The Xbox is new as described and seems to be working great! Thanks ProductPete.
659,Carlon Haughton,2022,5,"Graphics awesome, super fast, love it"
660,Kalev Kask,2021,5,"Worthy investment if you use it as an entertainment system (TV, movies, gaming).  With access to 600+ games and 5TB external WD Black drive this thing is a beast."
661,pitchaj,2020,5,"Xbox series x is the real deal. Fast load times. 60 frames per second on games like assassin's creed valhalla. The new controller is really nice, a bigger improvement than people think. Tons of games to play on gamepass. Setting it up is seamless. The series x console runs whisper quiet. Next generation is here and xbox is better than ever."
662,William Wittchow,2021,5,An amazing machine! Coming from only owning Playstation's to purchasing an Xbox Series X due to lack of availability of Playstation's I'm totally impressed! The speed and graphics are phenomenal and Ultimate Game Pass opens up a whole new world of games to explore. You really can't go wrong with the Series X!
663,Luis Zerpa,2022,5,"Only that, the Best console ever"
664,Yamiley M. Azor-Bell,2021,5,"My wife told me to purchase my X-box on Amazon and I have to tell you I thought she was crazy, but after getting it and installing it. I am SOLD.  I have no issues with it at all."
665,Kevon,2021,5,"Xbox Series X doesn’t really need a review, I’m just happy to get one at retail price in this world of scalping. All I can say is keep waiting on restock and don’t pay over retail"
666,Andrew werner,2021,5,"Wait to buy it at MSRP, $500. Don't give scalpers a single red cent. It's a great system, the graphics and load times are much better than last gen but you don't need it that badly, believe me. It's all the same games (for now) so just wait to get it at $500."
667,Sean,2020,4,"Thrilled to own the Series X. Despite the lack of a diverse set of launch titles, I truly appreciate the time Microsoft took on this console. Feels like a PC due to being paired with a new LG OLED TV. High frames @ 120Hz without sacrificing picture quality."
668,Daniel ,2020,5,Next gen gaming with the perfect style for my home decor. Loved the xbox one x and now I've upgraded to the series X.  There is a huge difference in performance but worth the wait and price. The new controller feels better in hand also. It's a great gaming purchase if you can get your hands on one.
669,Jennelle Yan,2021,5,"Great gift, husband loves it, says its amazing"
670,Sammi,2021,5,Was super scared to buy this online because of the price but it got here on time with no issues.
671,Tobey Cline,2021,5,He is gonna love it. Anything X box you can’t go wrong!
672,Maegan,2021,5,Finally able to get my hands on this for my husband! Says it’s a great upgrade so all my luck to you if you’re still trying to buy one. Your day will come.
673,Joseph B. Blaye,2021,5,I used it to play video games. I was afraid at 1st because the price was so low I thought it was a scam but when I saw Amazon was the seller I felt safe
674,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Have had one since launch. It's a powerful beast of a console but you really need to buy the TV to match.  With My Series X I purchased a LG Nano 91 with 4k, 120 GPS, and freesynch premium. Totally worth it. Gamepass is the future."
675,S.,2021,5,I love XBox for sports games
676,Jim Burwinkel,2021,5,"When I played an online co-op game, my friend had much slower loading times when on a previous generation of the Xbox.  When playing alone, the game loaded almost instantly.  Great to see an upgrade from a prior version!"
677,Hasbulla,2021,3,"Although I received this one, a lot of other people are having trouble getting one. One of those people being multiple people in my family. I’m sure they have a ton stocked up at the factory for the holidays. This breaks my heart that I can not get one for any family members. Other than that this console is amazing. Microsoft does not fail to exceed their expectations every new console release. If you think you could keep your Xbox one because this is not worth it you’re wrong. This price point is perfect for the ingenuity you receive in this product!"
678,J. Merrill,2020,5,Loving my Series X! I love how quick load times are for games and being able to switch between multiple games. Resolution is insanely good. Set up was really easy and you can set it up through an app. I also went for Game Pass which is a great value and basically lets me nerd out with tons of games!
679,Jo,2023,2,Seems fishy
680,Eli Brogden,2021,5,Lucky to get my hands on one. It’s everything I’ve hoped for.
681,Eduard Diaz,2021,5,"Some important features:*Simple, clean aesthetic*Quick resume feature for starting exactly where you left off*120hz gameplay mode with compatible TV (In my case I have the LG CX)*Backwards compatibility for nearly all games from every Xbox generation*Fast load times thanks to the custom SSD*Expandable storage"
682,griselda,2021,5,The series x was worth the price it hurt a little to buy due to the price point but besides that the graphics and how the console runs is amazing nba2k next gen on this console makes the game so much fun and the graphics are amazing I do recommend
683,Troy Bryant Jr.,2021,5,"A powerful machine, but definitely make sure you have a 4K capable TV with HDR+ support for Dolby Vision to fully take advantage of all the raw graphical power."
684,Ethan,2021,5,People say that it's huge but its actaully pretty darn small! It is smaller than the PS5 I've seen them side by side.
685,KT,2021,5,"Was lucky enough to get the series x.  There are no specific games out for this, but it makes all your old games better quality wise.  Very fast in load screens and the console is very quiet."
686,Ashkenaz,2022,1,"This product was sold as “new” I paid 600+ for it and the retail price is 500. The console came and only worked a few days before numerous games wouldn’t load or work with error codes. I ran thru an entire tutorial given by Microsoft to fix potential problems and Microsoft opened a case file for me and told me to return the product as a new Xbox shouldn’t be giving me these sort of problems. I’m out of 600+ dollars for a console sold as new now having to return it and then having to wait the time it can get to Amazon and then finally wait to see if I can even get my refund for what I paid for. This was a massive waste of time, effort and money. 0/Five don’t recommend."
687,Jenneth,2021,5,"Next gen is great, love the console"
688,kaleikekoa,2021,5,System is great it just sucks because of scalpers i had to pay over $700 for a $499 system but thats how the world is.
689,Larry,2021,4,*The Xbox Series X package was great.*The setup was simple & easy through the Xbox phone app.*Same old bad Xbox UI*Grab Xbox GamePass
690,Paolo Ortiz de Zevallos,2021,5,I like ig
691,Amazon Customer,2021,5,3-5x the experience vs previous generation.  $$$$ well spent.
692,Douglas,2021,5,"The Xbox Series X; I ordered was a brand new console, it runs as expected and it arrived on time. Not much else to say, but this is safer than buying from E-bay."
693,Nate,2020,5,"From the get-go, this console is easy to setup, think setting up a new iPhone. The quick resume feature is incredibly fast and ""Next Gen"" feeling. The Ray-Tracing is gorgeous and makes old games look new. The speed of the UI is so fast that I get left behind. Buy this console, it's mind blowing."
694,KZ,2021,5,Love it! Went to my cousins friends family overseas for their newphews birthday party. I'm really glad I managed a few for the whole family
695,Kristen Scarbrough,2020,5,"FINALLY! I made this preorder on September 22nd and was delayed, pushed back, and finally it shipped! This took way too long but I finally got my hands on it. I’m very happy, but boy was this a hot mess. The setup was super easy and installations are much faster. One happy gamer!"
696,Josephine Wheatley,2021,5,Very good
697,Jeremy Hilley,2021,5,This thing is amazing. Graphics are awesome. Download times are unbelievable. I cannot recommend a better gaming system right now. I’d buy another today for a family member or friend if I could.
698,Dosis-Dei,2021,5,- Really nice package- Can play 4K movies and past gen of Xbox games- Gamepass have over 100 games plus 50 EA games to play and download with a subscription- Series X games look incredible and run fast- Controller feels great
699,Nalin Kaushik,2021,5,"Fast, great processors and output!!!"
700,Zach,2021,5,"Paid the extra for it, didn’t even get to play it on 4K for a month, but the load times are better, graphics look great.Now the overall look is similar to Xbox one... but you can see the differences."
701,Amazon Customer,2021,5,I received the Xbox series X on the first business day.  Was supposed to come in 2 weeks at most. I am very pleased with the product. 👏
702,Manuel graham,2021,5,"Feels great, looks very cool"
703,Mo Doby,2021,4,Console is good but bundled with a garbage controller.  The replacement controller was even worse than the piece of garbage that came with it.
704,arturo,2021,5,"I love the simplicity of the design, it loads up all your games quick, microsoft also has good accessories that u can get with your series x that would elevate your gaming experience. Gamepass is awesome, download games and play. Plug and play."
705,Boujee B,2020,5,"Exceptional hardware. Loading times and smoother gameplay/graphics are the winners here. Same UI you're used to and snappy menus. Quick Resume is a great and old games look better than before. Game pass is the killer app so far. If microsoft can bring the exclusives in 2021, it's a home run for Xbox."
706,Ira Lichtenstein,2020,5,The worst part of playing video games is waiting for things to load.  Xbox X (not to be confused with Xbox One X) is pretty much perfect.  It loads super quickly.  Although I realized yesterday that it doesn't do 3d movies.  Glad I still have a working PS3.
707,James Cevallos,2021,5,This thing is beast of a console every game looks amazing auto hdr for is great and framerate boost on other older games is a game changer.
708,David Cruz,2021,5,"Got it on time, and with no damage at all on the day of release. Also picked up the statue of the Chief from Halo Infinite at Best Buy on the same day... too bad we will have to wait another year for Halo Infinite."
709,Ouija,2020,4,"Been using amazon for quite sometime now but the total lack of respect for a $500 console is mind boggling. The console may be damaged, and the box itself is a collectors item. Now it’s completely damaged."
710,Timothy Morrow,2021,5,The load times for Destiny 2 and the Halo games are significantly reduced with the Series X. Graphics output is great.
711,DTM,2020,5,It's an amazing piece of hardware that is going to have some amazing games on it in the next couple of years. Halo Infinite's delay definitely hurts the launch lineup but this console will have so many reasons to lay on it in 1-2 years time. Halo Infinite is 343's Halo 3.
712,Ryan Gartenmayer,2021,5,Came in super fast and greatly packaged so happy to have one
713,Shannon Michaels,2021,5,Excellent updated version of an Xbox console. It has a much faster system and my boyfriend loves the all black color.
714,Betty Fulmore-Thomas,2021,5,I purchased this for my nephew for Christmas in July and he absolutely loves it. The price was a little over the fair market price but he’s happy and I’m happy
715,Linh N.,2020,5,Who is the dingbat I owe my thanks for packaging this Xbox?The Xbox is great and fits into my media center. I love that it is very backwards compatible so my existing library moves with me. It doesn’t feel like I’ve lost my investment for the past few years.
716,Lee,2020,5,I have zero complaints about this console and if you like the Xbox one x then you will absolutely love this Xbox. It is quieter and runs cooler while also being far more powerful. It runs games incredibly smooth so if you are thinking about getting one then I fully recommend it.
717,Scott Kinross,2021,5,"It came in great condition. I don't normally write reviews but I am so happy to be playing on my lightning quick xbox series X, I love it so much and no issues with it at all!!! Wooho win"
718,Ryan S. Wheeling,2021,5,"It is a Xbox Series X and it plays games wellalso Game pass is must, endless games to play"
719,Nataly,2021,5,The console runs smooth. Worth the money. Can’t wait for the new HALO!
720,Michael Montanez,2020,5,"Got the console day one and it's been great! it's quiet, doesn't get too hot, quick resume is great and with Xbox Game Pass I can play hundreds of games on this console...and some of them even have Series X updates to take advantage of the console. LOVING IT SO FAR."
721,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Been an Xbox fan since the OG.  This is an amazing system.  1st party game selection is a little slim at launch but there's a lot of previous gen games upgraded to run on this thing.  Very lucky I was able to get one on release day.
722,Joe,2022,1,"Amazon's customer service wouldn't let me return the product because I was out of the country and missed their return window.I am now battling with Microsoft to have them fix the console. The console simply does not work. You turn it on to run a Series X game, and it freezes and crashes.The controller also has issues. Making weird noises while vibrating. I feel like it was dropped somewhere in a warehouse or something. Makes ZERO sense.The only thing that runs on it - are YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video."
723,bleeder,2022,2,i had original xbox-the 360 & they were great machines. it was plug & play this one you need to be a computer programer to set it up. but real killer for me was: will play 4 generations of past games. it does not. i have the halo games & it will not play any of them. it is a high price blue ray player. save money &buy he xbox s or a play station. this thing will probably end up in a dumpster.
724,heguancheng,2021,5,good
725,Ashton,2021,5,Other than mark up over msrp I am pleased with my purchase.
726,Dustin,2021,5,Works as I expected it to. Soon as some exclusives come out it will be even better.  The size and shape is great for the space I have.
727,kelly merlino,2021,5,I got my ps5 it was slower and could not hold as much games Xbox series x runs better can hold more games and it's really cool look looking 10/10
728,Kwame Sanders,2022,1,"I bought this Xbox on Nov 6th, 2022, received it on Nov 10th, 2022, and it died on Dec 5th, 2022, didn't even last a month, and I didn't even use it that much, probably played a few games, and it literally died in the middle of a game... I would not recommend this purchase. I'd give this Zero stars if it would allow me..."
729,Kyle Richards,2021,5,Came in time and xbox ran perfectly
730,Phillip M. Yates,2021,5,It does what is advertised. No complaints really. It wont be the system that makes this purchase worth it; it will be the games.
731,Pablo D Rivera Torres,2021,5,I love my Xbox Series X is Huge but the resolution and memory worth the money
732,Bradley Ham,2020,5,Coming from Xbox One S I immediately saw an improvement on my LG OLED when I played Apex Legends on the Xbox Series X. Load times are incredibly faster and the graphics are night and day. Very very smoooooooooooth. Worth every penny for this alone. Very happy customer! 😁😁
733,Vanessa,2021,5,Waited a long time to be able to buy this and about as rare as a blue moon I saw it on Amazon for its msrp. Worth it!
734,Txou,2021,5,"Great Console! GamePass is a game changer, been playing a whole lotta games and they all plah great. Really looking forward to what Xbox brings to the table this generation. They started with a bang!"
735,Dave,2021,5,"Faster loading, way better graphics especially in 4K. Microsoft did a great job with this!"
736,David,2020,4,"Just got it today, games look good and cables seem fine. My box was all scuffed up which was very disappointing for how expensive it is. So far it was worth it overall"
737,Joseph Alteri,2021,5,"Quick Resume, Smart Delivery, Backwards Compatibility, Game Pass, FPS Boost - Microsoft is delivering to its customers with the Series X. Get one!!"
738,Orochi,2020,5,"Setup was super simple. I just plugged in my old HDD, and all my X1X console settings were downloaded from the cloud.I’ve had no issues so far. Every game I put in l runs beautifully, and load times are minimal. Good stuff, and it just works."
739,Mitchel P. Greene,2021,5,"Box arrived in 2 days. Perfect condition, brand new in original packaging.  Didn't like paying premium,  but what can you do."
740,Max,2021,4,"Really good processing power and picture. It has some connectivity issues/bugs which can be easily fixed by cold-restarting the console, but other than that it is great."
741,Jesse,2021,5,I preordered it way back and got it on my birthday which i was hoping for.  Works great and the controller has no issues either.  It loads so much faster than my xbox one s did.
742,Taylor Kornberg,2020,3,"What the console can do is good, but there is no new exclusives games for launch. I feel that’s a huge loss for Microsoft. Not really any reason to get this console until sometime next year when there will be some exclusives. The looks of this console doesn’t feel next gen and not a fan of how the insides are built/put together. Going to be a massive pain to clean this thing."
743,BSmooth40,2021,5,"Have had this console since February and really enjoy it, 120 hertz looks great, games load super fast, graphics and frame rates are stable, and it's quiet!"
744,Scott,2021,5,I received the item earlier than expected and on a Sunday! My wife loves it. She says the game lag is gone!
745,Lino Navarro,2021,4,Shipping box and product box was damaged
746,Rashid Sharif,2021,5,The system arrived way earlier than stated. Came well packaged and secure. Easy to set up and play immediately. Would definitely order from you guys again.
747,Mohammed,2021,5,"Its good but it only crashes in 1 game and that is... Cold War. Other than that its amazing, looks clean and fits in most spots. Its way smaller than it looks and yeah."
748,Konrad Patrzalek,2021,4,"I liked how it works with all my old games, except for overwatch which seems to be running at a lower resolution than actual 4k weird.."
749,3DTech,2021,5,I moved from the OG fat Xbox one to the Series X and wow the speeds on this is unreal. i love the quick resume feature and the 4K gaming ability. The games look so much better on the new console.
750,Amazon Customer,2021,5,My package didn’t get delivered but I got one from Target. The Xbox is amazing nonetheless. The UI could be better but it’s a beast. It does give off a lot of heat.
751,Anm8ed,2020,5,It’s an XBox. It does what it’s supposed to and does it well. Load times are significantly better for everything I play. Much more enjoyable but no drink/potty breaks on loading screens. Looking forward to playing a game designed  to use it better.
752,Sheldon mayer,2021,5,Very upsetting I bought a Xbox over 700 dollars and now it’s not working and I just opened it
753,Kyle B,2020,5,"Really great product, a few bugs when getting started (logging in and setting up the console account) but, those will be ironed out with a software update. Make sure to use a 4K tv with at least 60hz if you want the most out of the experience."
754,Megan Lewis,2021,5,Arrived on time and I was able to give to the hubs for his bday. He's been enjoying the new speed and awesome graphics.
755,Amazon Customer,2021,5,It came came early and like it should. I love these people. Get on while you can for $807 expedited you can get in the game.
756,Matthew Franks,2020,5,"Truly a next generation experience. From the way the console loads games to the  graphics, this machine is an absolute monster in the best possible way. Haven't had any problems at all and simply cannot get enough of this console. 10/10 would recommend."
757,Ryan Stowers,2021,5,I'm really happy with my purchase and if your having any doubts about the reliability of this seller I had zero issues with them
758,Carlos L,2021,5,I’m happy with the increased overall performance of the Series X compared to the One X. Really looking forward to see how game developers take advantage of the increased horsepower within the next couple or years!
759,Andrew Dawson,2021,5,Each Xbox has been better than the last. What's not to like? 10/10

764,Ruben Estrada,2021,5,Very fast shipping product is as advertised 👍🏽😁
765,Andrew James Medanich,2020,5,Absolutely an amazing console that makes every single last gen game run at its fullest potential without any optimization. Everything takes less time and with the Xbox App you dont even have to be home to set up or install all of your games.
766,Visionary Courses,2021,4,Good system poor game selection
767,Clyde E.,2021,5,it go good
768,Ice,2022,1,"Was looking forward to the XBox Series X system.However, the Blu-ray player skipped audio on the first day.Disc was brand new....(Yakuza Princess  Blu-ray  4K Ultra HD).The second day, trying a different brand new Blu-ray 4K UHD disk (No Time to Die).The player skipped audio multiple times and then the video went competely black.I believe my Xbox Series X was made May 2022.OS Build 10.0.22000.4975There are numerous internet reports of defective Blu-rayer players in the XBox Series X.Also, good to note is that the Blu-ray app on the XBox Series X is outdated and in desperate need of an update.I returned the XBox Series X the same day."
769,Dusty,2020,5,Love this new console although the top can be a little bit hot. But that is almost with every console. Graphics are good and this is a very sleek look to it. Remotes are very sturdy and sleek as well

775,Robert,2021,5,I would highly recommend this product

777,EdEddandEdge,2020,5,The series x has exceeded my expectations.  Super quiet.  About as loud as a field mouse pissing on cotton.  Picked up cod cold war and it is amazing.  Thank you amazon.  Do not pay scalpers for one.
778,Sarah E,2021,5,"The package was damaged, but Xbox did a great job at protecting their item. I use it everyday and the processing and graphics are awesome. The SSD drive allows for fast loading times. It’s truly a great system"

786,Matthew Randall,2021,5,Love everything about it. Great upgrade from the Xbox one s. Don’t buy unless it’s the normal price.
787,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Absolutely wonderful, so much room on this thing and way awesome graphics. Lowest price I have seen on them too!"
788,Spartancollector,2020,5,"This system is SMOOTH as butter. You can't get any better than if you go full fledged gaming PC. Going from a first gen Xbox one S to this, super nice. FYI those smoking videos are faked with vapes lol wtf."
789,Casey,2021,3,It plays well but it super heats my room if I play for more than 2 hours. Everything today is overrated and marketed to be jesus in a box but turns out to be a hunk of junk. What a waist
790,Miguel Victor Jr,2021,5,Game looks super amazing and it’s really fast compared to Xbox one x and it’s very compact in space and a super quiet

793,Alexander Lewis,2021,5,Oh boy do I love this thing everything runs so fast and smooth and on top of all that the Unboxing was premium feeling. My only complaint is the price.
794,Hugh,2020,5,"An absolute must have for any Xbox fan, the set up is super easy.  If you own an LG cx series tv you are gonna be blown away.  Be sure to use a Ultra High speed HDMI cable!"

800,Jessica,2021,5,Would highly recommend. This is definitely a step up from the xbox one possibly my favorite gen of console not because of quick loading speeds but I really like the shape.
801,Mario,2020,3,"My XBSX had trouble connecting to 5Ghz wifi and would turn off on its own after just minutes of gameplay on any game. Really sucks, sent it in for repair/replacement this morning.Also, i dont like how it doesnt feel like an upgrade cause of the UI. I understand the xbox team has constantly been working on the XB1 UI to what they considered perfection but i dont know, i just wish the experience felt more new.Overrall i’m very happy for my purchase, i know im just an unlucky one"
802,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Amazing if you miss out on next gen try to pick up a one X it was way ahead of its time enhanced games HDR 4K it was 3 years ahead of its time and way underrated.
803,Brad Mills,2020,5,This thing is fast. Definitely a generational leap in terms of speed and jumping around the UI. Games look incredible. The build quality is fantastic. It's all around an incredible package for the price. Highly recommend this to anyone.
804,Booky Djumanov,2021,5,"Since I got this Xbox X, Ive been playing non-stop all day! Its tremendously enjoyable, and very engaging. This product takes gaming to the next level!"

815,Patti,2021,5,The company is legit. Xbox works great thanks guys.
816,Cameron,2022,1,"Was very excited to finally be getting a Series X. Did not notice anything to begin with. The when I began to play a game for the first time it almost immediately shutdown, claiming it was due to poor ventilation. Upon closer inspection the top fan does not spin at all. Very disappointed. This seller has a lot of positive reviews and that was the only reason I bought ""Used-Like New"". Very conflicted if I want to try again or not."
817,A.M.,2020,5,"This thing is a HUGE upgrade from the Xbox One. The 120 FPS is a big deal, even if you have poor internet, it helps make up for that. Definitely a buy for the gamer in your life."
818,Karen,2020,5,Runs like a dream! Everything about the console so far has been great. Solid 4K 60FPS (limited by my TV) is very nice compared to the One S. Games load extremely fast due to the SSD.
819,El Jefe,2021,5,Best console to me! Just sucks how games take so much memory only have 2 games WZ and Cold War and it’s at 56% of memory left!
820,Dana Wood,2021,5,"No issues, and the kids love it of course."
821,Erik Melkic,2021,5,"Came in really fast, and had no issues with it. Price may be much but definitely worth it."

827,Ricanlegend,2021,5,Love it
828,Devan,2020,5,Loving the Series X so far. Games look and feel amazing. Load times are fast. Can't wait to play a game that was built for it and takes advantage of the power behind it.
829,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"The console runs games great and loading times are way quicker than before. Its quiet but does take up a bit of space. Also, its way heavier than you would think. Its great overall."
830,G.L.G,2021,5,Like it and was fast shipping

834,Gracie Sheen,2021,5,"The xbox is great! Although it should be against the law for a seller to price gouge a market already set from the manufacturer. XBOX 👍, seller👎💩"
835,GreatSauron,2021,5,Got mine a week ago. Really worth the money and time tried to got one. Good luck to you all on getting one.
836,Scott Kirkland,2021,5,If you've owned an Xbox One it does exactly the same thing just way faster and with better resolution in an imposingly large box.
837,Shannon,2021,5,"Definitely is a beast, but is well worth worth the wait and money. Just waiting for Elder Scrolls 6"
838,Eddie Kim,2020,4,"love playing my old games on it, they all seem to perform much better.  I do wish there were more launch games"
839,Ashley,2021,5,Received in 2 days. Graphics are amazing. Starts up fast and quiet as a mouse.
840,Escoboy17's newphew,2021,5,Awesome console! My son loves playing with this. 10/10 would buy again.
841,Josh ,2021,5,I’m so glad I was able to finally get my hands on one. My little brother loves this thing more than he loves me.
842,Robert Gering,2021,3,"Its OK...it happens. I am a Xbox fan and I will be waiting for a new one when they come back into stock. This one had a update error during setup, Worked with MS support. they did a good job trying different things, but after a few days we decided it was best to send it back. Probably a bad SSD or OS setup. Support was responsive and the rep was good."
843,Salman Ahmad,2021,5,Great load times and graphics the quick resume feature is the beat
844,Francisco M.,2021,5,Lucky enough to order it once it was available and got it within 27 hours after placing the order. Amazon is amazing and the Console too.

850,LB Moreno,2020,5,When the Xbox series X was a super tough item to purchase this Covid year. We found fast service and are very happy with the results for a deserving recipient.
851,JPR,2020,5,This console is amazing. The controller feels similar but much better because of the small changes they made to it. Loading times and graphics are just as good as the Xbox advertisements said.
852,Josh,2021,5,Amazon delivered this safe and sound. Very pleased with the ease of setup as well!
853,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Had zero trouble out of this thing. Enjoying all the time I’ve put on it so far. Quick resume will change your life. Get the ultimate game pass if you get this

864,Joseph G. Hynes,2021,5,Ordered It. Delivered. On Time. Works Flawlessly (thus far). Quite Pleased (and grateful).
865,Jeremy,2021,5,Fast and powerful. This is the top of the line for console gaming.
866,Ryan,2020,5,The series X is crazy fast I play a lot of Sea of Thieves and haven't noticed any load times or when fast travelling back to the ship its all instant.
867,kindlefirelover,2020,4,"To my surprise the power cord wouldn’t fit in the console all the way, coming out of the console when playing."
868,Ryan,2020,5,"The Xbox series X is every bit as good as Xbox said it’d be. The real cherry on top isn’t actually the console, it’s the game pass service with EA play."
869,Christopher Johnson,2021,5,Xseries arrived when advertised and in perfect condition
870,Vibhav Salgaonkar,2020,5,Next gen awaits! I was fortunate enough to get my preorder in and my order was delivered on time. I can't wait to boot up the console and play AC Valhalla!
871,BrownBunch,2021,5,Was lucky enough to get on day one. The kids are excited.
872,Brah Dude,2020,5,"What a fantastic console. Does everything right and the value is insane. I have this and the PS5, but I’m on this one most of the time."
873,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Una consola con buenos materiales y excelente potencia
874,James A. Beatty,2021,5,"Bleeding edge graphics, and tons of backwards compatibility. HOORAY!"
875,Bekzod Djumanov,2021,5,One of the few products that actually grab my attention. Absolutely lovely home console for my kids.
876,Jomario D.,2021,5,Lots of power! In my opinion better than the Ps5
877,300,2021,5,This is a console with great performance. You should buy it with XGPU. With XGPU you can play over 300 games.
878,tequila,2020,5,"My nephew says the X series is the best. No lagging, good graphic quality, and processing speed is much faster than the older version that he had"
879,LosJetssssss,2021,5,New Xbox series x on point. Brand new easy to install.
880,Scott,2020,5,I was able to preorder and it arrived on day one ....it’s a very heavy but quiet machine ....everything runs great and does what it is supposed to do ....

882,Ben,2020,5,"I actually got mine! I love it so far. It's quiet, fast, and it works with my 1080p 144hz monitor until I upgrade. Can't wait for Halo Infinite and Cyberpunk"
883,Kmak,2021,5,A must buy for xbox fans and gamers alike. I am shocked as to how stunning beautiful the older games look as well.
884,Iamad Hamad,2020,3,"The console is good, but it doesn't feel like a next gen console. The only difference is that I can notice that I am loading into games faster. Unfortunately, some games will freeze forcing me to exit out or restart the console, this could be a game issue and not a console issue. Overall, the system is good, but there is no need to rush until better optimized games are ready."
885,Nathanael Petker,2021,3,Pre-ordered a series X and my original order was cancelled so I reordered one from Amazon and when it finally arrived and I opened the box all the cords were bunched up and the controller had the batteries in it and had clearly been used. System works fine so far but it was a bit disappointing to get a new system that was clearly already used by somebody.
886,shelon,2021,5,Love it. No issues with it and game on it daily since launch.
887,Cesar B,2020,5,"Very quick, great graphics, performance, and a major upgrade from my Xbox one S. Glad I was able to get my hands on it on release date as well!"
888,Peter,2021,5,"Somehow I was able to beat all the scalpers and bots.  Shipped quick, arrived in two days.  Awesome!!"
889,Dukes,2020,5,Delivered on release day and this console is better than I thought it would be. I'm blown away by the load times and graphics as well as refresh rate.
890,Jupiterjewelryco,2020,5,Worth every penny. Xbox manages to keep me in their circle for another generation and I’m looking forward to see more things the series X has to offer!
891,franky j caba,2020,5,It is even better looking in person. The design is so sleek and fits right into my living room set up without looking out of place.
892,MikeyintheD,2020,5,"Roth every penny.  Lightning quick startup, great graphics that you call tell a difference the first time you play and future proof for several years."
893,Cera Albu,2020,5,"Amazon was the only place I had a chance Getting the Xbox. Once it was ordered, I was excited to get the Xbox on time and works great!"

903,Andrew Wilson,2021,3,"Best console in regards to hardware, but doesn't have the game selection that the PS5 does."
904,Terracon ,2021,5,"Once that magic in-cart option showed, everything was great. Just keep trying people, the Xbox is incredibly fast"
905,Guy,2020,5,Awesome. SSD and Quick Resume are game changers. Everything thing you love about Xbox but faster and prettier. Can’t wait to see what the first party studios create!
906,Robert T.,2020,5,"Love the accessory backwards compatibility,  performance upgrades for catalog titles, inaudible cooling solution, and advanced hardware/software features which will require time for developers to fully exploit."
907,james,2020,3,"I bought this console for the next gens games but every time I try to play a next gen game my console turns off after 30 mins of playing. This only happens to next gen games. I paid good money for this Console and I expected great things, come on Microsoft smh. The game runs smoothly before the console turns off. Everything else works really good no overheating or anything."
908,Mrs. Harris,2021,5,I love the new Xbox. I love Amazon and I was so happy to make my purchase here.

912,CAL,2020,5,It’s been a while since I’ve upgraded consoles and it really shows in the speed and graphics. Glad I was able to get it on release day!
913,Kyle,2021,5,Very quite even after gaming for a few hours straight. Does give off some heat but not much
914,Anonymous,2020,5,This is probably one of the best Xboxs made. I’ve had every generation and this is 100 times faster than the Xbox One X. Worth the money.
915,JBH,2020,5,"This runs amazing, it runs games amazingly, the setup was a breeze, all my old accessories from my Xbox One work on it, I love this console."
916,Spencer McAvoy,2020,5,Really happy I lucked out. It's a  shame you didn't stop bots from buying most your stock but I got the golden ticket.
917,Andrea L,2020,5,"The console is great! This generation console feels just like a gaming computer, it's worth buying so hopefully they start getting more in stock."

1018,Silent Avenger,2022,1,"After waiting months to find at the $499.99 MSRP through Amazon, and waiting a couple of weeks for the order to arrive, I get a POS that died the first day of gaming.  After wasting time to set it up, I purchased and downloaded a couple of new X series enhanced games. I then was played Gears 5 X/S for about 25 minutes and it the XBox X screeched, my LG OLED screen went blank and the system died and will not restart.  I see now that this is beginning to be a common issue due to a bunch of bad chips as of late."
1019,Brian A Offord,2020,5,Preorders were a mess but did you really expect them not to be? With that being said this thing is amazing totally worth it

1050,MICHAEL J.,2022,1,"So, I got this last night.  Managed to get it setup and even got Game Pass Ultimate.  Upon downloading the first game its freezes the download and says my hard drive may be corrupt.  I then factory reset it and re-setup eveything again.  I finally get the game loaded and begin playing and it suddenly shuts off in the middle of gameplay and I cannot get it to boot now."
1051,Earnestine Pitchford,2021,5,My son is to happy
1052,Cameron,2021,5,Good
1053,Kris W,2020,1,"Over the years, I've invested in digital licenses for games.  felt like the future.  When the series x came out, I decided to give my xbox one S to my kids so they could play their games.  If we try to play at the same time, even though it is not the same game, we aren't allowed.  Okay... surely it will work if I sign in with my Kid's xbox live account that is connected to mine through family controls right?  Nope.  Maybe there is a way to loan the game or transfer the license?  Nope.  Basically I'm SOL, and will be looking for physical used games this holiday season for my kids.  The technology is ready for digital licensing, but MS is not.  I suggest buying physical (preferably used so it hurts their bottom line) until they empower digital owners.The series x itself has been fine.  Crashing a fair amount, but for now I blame that on COD:Cold War"
1054,Joel Guzmán C,2020,5,"The console is very fast, 0 problems with software or hardware, noiseless."
1055,YEEZY,2021,5,Bought it because of the nice black box only.

1070,MATTHEW WARREN,2020,5,"Amazing console!!! If you can get your hands on one, be fast!!"
1071,Ismael Cantu-Garcia,2021,5,Better than ps5
1072,David R,2021,2,As far as just the console goes for next gen it's great. It does everything you'd want for this generation and probably more down the line however that's where my praise ends. I got mine for 700 and I'm still dirty for it. Only reason I got this was because I literally can't afford $1500+ worth of gpus. Imagine I would be much happier on my first pic but everyone and their mother needs these it feels like
1073,Dani,2021,5,"Works great, looks great"
1074,baddog,2021,5,The Xbox series X is awesome

1080,ERIC,2020,5,Amazing console. Games looks incredible. Load times are insanely fast.
1081,Gabe,2022,1,"When ordering with 12 month equal pay option, it charged me full amount. When i called Amazon, i was told that i ordered it wrong. I am not sure what that means because in my order detail screen, it clearly says i ordered with 12 month equal pay option. To add salt to the injury, no 5% reward for using Amazon Prime visa card. Fix this Amazon instead of telling your customers that they ordered it wrong.The product itself is fine. Really underestimated how hot it gets."
1082,james banks,2021,5,Fast shipping and great product
1083,BiologicalBill,2021,5,Great.... bout time
1084,Adrian Hernandez,2021,5,The best console ever
1085,Bandana,2021,5,"Great system! Smooth, fast and reliable. Love it!"
1086,Amazon Customer,2022,1,"Wow, the arrogance of this console’s specs are simply breathtaking. Still no bluetooth headphones - gotta use theirs! No optical audio unline every other console they made. Data harvesting around every corner. Doesn’t even play Blu-Rays or CDs out of the box - you have to download Blu-Ray and even CD player apps (that suck). 4K/120 only works for a tiny sliver of the market, for everyone else with a 4K TV or lower, get a OneX. Barely worth the price for the 4K/120 crowd, for everyone else, seriously not worth it."
1087,Dylan nickerson,2020,5,"Xbox started smoking after 30 minutes, but Destiny 2 looked clean!"
1088,Jonathan Bonilla,2021,5,Excelente
1089,Ahmad Jones,2020,5,It’s amazing. Better than the ps5 for sure.

1140,Gavin B.,2021,3,"Arrived safely, works great. Giving 3 stars because of the difficulty in finding one."
1141,Slowwpo,2020,5,This item was awesome.
1142,brittany,2021,3,Xbox is great however it has a big issue currently where when you replace the controller batteries the controller won’t reconnect to the Xbox unless you hard reset the Xbox.
1143,Cory,2022,4,"Xbox Series X is a game changer in the gaming world. It plays true 4K gaming, up to 120 frames per seconds, 8K HDR (High Dynamic Range), and Xbox Velocity Architecture. You can play thousands of titles from the previous Xbox consoles which is a plus for me. I like to play Halo, Dead by Daylight, and Resident Evil. I had this system for 2 years and I recommend buying this product. In my experience in playing the Xbox series X I noticed the better graphics and faster loading screen. Also, Xbox Series X allows you to play backward compatible games from the previous consoles. This brings your old games back to life.The Xbox Series X or PS5 both go for $500 dollars. For the right investment I would choose Xbox Series X because the PS5 has a failed network issue meaning it can't connect to the internet which I’m sure most gamers would hate. PS5 also doesn't support dolby vision either so If you’re looking to just play Blu-ray discs with support of Dolby Vision for games, Blu-ray, or apps such as Netflix the Xbox Series X is the only one that supports it.Xbox Series X also only has a 1TB storage space which is limited but if you run out of space you can buy an expansion card or a hard drive to give you more. The reason why you would need more space is because it impacts the number of games you can install onto your system. Most games are 100 to 120 GB in file size so I would recommend buying a hard drive with more space because 1 TB would run out of space quickly.  The expansion card cost $219.99 dollars and the hard drive cost $25 to $300 dollars depending how much storage you want for your system.Some additional weaknesses of the Xbox Series X are the controller and where the share button is located. It's between the menu and the view button and it takes photos during game play because I accidentally hit the button which is annoying. Another disadvantage is not enough exclusive games because most games could also be found in the PC world. Also, keeping it in an enclosed space can cause the console to overheat and turn off which only happened once to me.In conclusion, the Xbox series X is a quality gaming system that is user friendly, built for faster speed, and worth the investment."
1144,michael aguirre,2020,5,Would buy another one

1154,Malinda,2022,1,"After everything was done updating and downloading I was only able to use it for 20 minutes before it shut off and was unable to turn back on, it’s now approaching two weeks since I sent it back and I have yet to receive my refund or a reason why it’s taking this amount of time. Disappointed in Amazon and Microsoft, one for sending a faulty product at full price, and two, not getting refunded at all (at this current point)."

1167,Christopher Heard,2022,1,Literally every single game I played crashed...luckily the return process was quick and easy and I got my money back. Don't buy unless you like taking strolls to the post office to ship stuff back to manufacturers.
1168,Adam Macqueen,2021,2,"I love the Xbox, it runs smooth and looks so amazing. But there are certain games that won’t work. It’ll load for 30 seconds but then force close the game. I’ve done everything I can but nothing has worked. Kinda upset Bc this is happened with 25% of the games I own."
1169,joseph,2020,5,Best console
1170,Andrew,2020,5,Very nice!!!

1175,vefe75,2020,5,Everything!
1176,Revan_Deschain,2020,1,"This console obviously needed further bug testing. After FINALLY getting my day 1 preorder, I was ecstatic. My mood quickly sullied when about a week after purchasing, for some reason the console would be set at 640x480 resolution, with no fix available. The ""solutions"" online do not work, and there's no official word from Microsoft. This is NOT a TV issue. My Xbox One, PS4 and Switch all work perfectly fine. It's just the Series X. It apparently doesn't matter what kind of TV you have, it affects a whole bunch of them. A total headache. You should wait for the Xbox Series XYZ to come out in a year - maybe that one will actually work as advertised. I'm going to try to go about getting a refund."
1177,Count Chocula,2020,5,First!
1178,Linsey Payne,2020,5,Amazing
1179,John,2020,5,👍🏼
1180,Justin Jacobs,2021,3,"This is a great product, but needs to get the kinks out of the system. I have been an xbox person since the original box."
1181,Zachery Simmons,2022,1,Ordered the Xbox and it never would work every game my kids tried to play it would freeze up. Resent the Xbox and it’s been over 2 week and still no refund or any sort of update of when a refund will be issued .
1182,Si,2022,1,Within 2 months the controller has drift and most games keep crashing even after a factory reset  … do yourself a favor and buy a PS5
1183,Scooby Dooby Doo,2021,1,"I got my Xbox series x and it never turned on. I was unable to exchange it on Amazon because they did not have any Instock. I sent it to Microsoft to get the faulty power supply fixed and it will take over a month because of covid. On top of that I had to pay 10$ For shipping. Also a warning for those buying on Amazon, the one year limited warranty on my system was activated in January even though I bought it in February. I would love to give it a better review but all I got was a massive brick."
1184,Carl Mortensen,2023,1,The Xbox controllers never connect. I’ve tried wirelessly and wired. It’s defective.
1185,Aleenat,2020,2,The menu on this new Xbox is atrocious and annoying to navigate. Take me back to when the Xbox 360 menu was out before it also got ruined. The controller is the same as always and there’s not many exclusive games out there. I would recommend waiting to buy this or get a ps5
1186,Tom,2020,1,"Have had major problems with this console. The disc drive doesn’t read discs after u turn the console off unless u eject and reinsert. Games like COD MW and Cold War lag incredibly bad to the point it’s unplayable due to the stuttering, yet when I try my Xbox one on the same tittles there is no lag at all. Lastly, my Xbox series x shuts completely down randomly in the middle of games - it’s done it 5 times sometimes back to back.Would not recommend buying until they patch all these problems (hopefully they can be patched"
1187,Colton,2021,2,"Its an Xbox series X, but at almost double the price. I was desperate because my xbox broke. I highly recommend going anywhere else and just ordering one at MSRP not this mark up."
1188,Amazon Customer,2021,2,The product was way overpriced.  The product itself is rated 5 stars but the price is why I gave it 2 stars.
1189,John Smith,2020,1,"When I got it games would shut off either immediately or within the hour. I don't know what was wrong, I think it had a faulty power supply. I sent it back; took more than two weeks to get it back with expedited service that I paid an extra $10 for. I received the HDMI and AC power cord a week later in a different box, and I've yet to get the controller back; it's been 4 weeks.I could have purchased a PS5 and I wouldn't have had any of these problems. Stupid mistake."
1190,Allen D Jr.,2022,1,This is not an Xbox X. This is a Xbox S for the same price as one that only has the console and nothing else. Do not buy this product
1191,Erica Perkins,2021,3,Price sucked but it came a day early
1192,jeff,2022,1,So I decided to buy this console thinking it was backwards compatible with 360 games that I have a ton of .  Hardly any of the games are backwards compatible . XBOX barely has any exclusives titles.  Not impressed .
1193,Aundra Collins,2022,1,This Seller sales broke consoles that do not work nor function at all.
1194,David Jackson,2022,1,"Half of the games don't have the option for this feature in their settings. Which makes ps5 way better if you don't want to aim and shoot with the triggers, and instead with the bumpers"
1195,Vince Lee,2021,3,"The product was great, smaller than I expected"
1196,Brendan the football manager,2023,5,"Got this as a Christmas gift and previously played on the series s and the series x is a great console, and seems to have more storage than the series s and it runs well"
1197,Sarah-Hayley Owen,2022,1,"Turns out there IS a known issue affecting these consoles: a strong, chemical-y smelling burning smell that doesn't dissipate with time. Hesitant to get a PS5 as it has few games I'm interested in, but I'm sure not getting another Series X console of this variety. Hope MSFT releases a non-beta version in the near future."
1198,Guy,2022,5,The new Xbox Series X is an amazing machine. Fast and reliable. If you liked Xbox one you’ll love the X. Only down side is 1Tb drive so you may want an external drive.Personally I have mine on a desk with a keyboard and mouse. Basically acts like a gaming pc for 1/4 the cost.

1203,renee brewer,2022,1,The HDMI out doesn’t work
1204,Irving Orozco,2020,1,I pre order this item and once received two days later after release day I was really disappointed it would turn off on me out of nowhere and would not turn back on at all. I had to shipped out to Microsoft so they could take a look at it but really disappointed how I didn’t get to enjoy my brand new Xbox and even worse I have to wait even longer now.
1205,D,2022,5,"Great system, Great graphics. Expensive $70 games, socks u can't resell games."
1206,Richard Newell,2022,1,Console did not load any series x/s optimized titles without immediately crashing :( recommend buying new somewhere else
1207,Shawn P Vigneri,2020,1,"I was very excited to receive my console on launch day after waiting 2 months from the pre-order. I was able to setup the console but it quickly died. The screen started flashing green then it shut off. After that it would either boot and then shut off after a minute or not boot at all. Lesson learned, don't buy the first generation of Microsoft's products!"
1208,kenneth,2022,1,"Xbox only no power cord no controller. Would not recommend due to lack or power cord, controller and price."
1209,james landess,2020,2,"Loads faster and looks a tiny bit better. Next Gen? Not at this point. My review remains the same almost 2 months later. You're buying an upgraded Xbox One! Thanks for the ""Next Generation Console""."
1210,Ashley,2021,1,Very disappointed As I’m a very big Xbox gamer I have over $10k in games in my collection and that’s just Xbox games. I low key feel like this is a scam you log into your Xbox and go to play the next time and it does work. Then you send it back now your still logged in and they can “fix” and have access to your account. I’m very disappointed
1211,Talk Development,2022,1,I paid $800 and after a year and a half it's already not working. Of course the warranty is expired.
1212,Elaina Bennett,2022,5,Finally available to order! Thankful its in time for Christmas! What a wonderful gift. He was so shocked and excited.
1213,Amazon Customer,2020,1,Everything was great then it just turned off and now it will not come back on. Called Microsoft and they were no help at all. I have always had Xbox and have not had any real issues until now.Now when looking online you can find all kinds of people with the same issue.
1214,Daniel A.,2022,5,Love this console. It fits neatly behind the tv.
1215,Joyce,2022,1,It is defective and I can't get any help to fix the problem even with a 2 year protection plan.
1216,Chase,2022,1,Only got this xbox because it's the only new one you can get... they do selling the Xbox 1 which is ashame cause I would have had rather had that. New Xbox won't load halo 5 and it just cliches and freezes my Xbox then shuts off. Way too much money for and electronic that doesn't even do what is suppose to.
1217,Betty,2022,1,Not that great thought I would be more powerful and the graphics would be better I thought I’d work better on shooter games by call of duty and battlefield get crushed by PC hackers cross play trash if I was you I’d spend a little bit more and just get a good PC with a good graphics card
1218,Bill Payer,2022,1,"Got from an invite, got this ""new"" xbox series x, but in reality the xbox series x was used and a damaged box.  Feel tricked."
1219,Brandon Levesque,2022,5,I've had this since launch and have played it daily since it was delivered. The console is a power house and really steps up to the next gen expectations. The graphics on Series X games are an amazing step up form the Xbox one. Games run so much smoother and the visuals are 10 fold better then previous gen consoles. There are only a few exclusives right now but they definitely have some big hits that make this console a must have.
1220,jacob robbins,2022,1,It arrived today and it needed a system update but it has been stuck on step one out of 3 for hours it just says download complete and will not move on to the next step
1221,Ed,2022,5,Had to go through Xbox all access to get my hands on this Xbox console. Pretty good Xbox. It stays cool and load times are pretty quick.
1222,tj_M,2022,4,"A StoryThe ReasonI've been a Sony user since shortly after the PlayStation first released in the US.-Had everything Sony. Sony Portable Cassette player (Sport), later VAIO PC/LaptopMinidiskman, and Bravia home theater...""Ok, Maybe a Sony 'Fan Boy' was a more accurate depiction.""After several recent bad dealing with Sony, their product & customer support, issues with PS direct canceling orders, and general distribution mayhem.Here I am, I finally gave up hope on Sony, and I bought several of these.I was able to pick one up at a local B*st B*y for retail. *With a free game promotion.*I ordered 3x more from W*lm*rt, along with two series S. ""There wasn't any buying restrictions.""Moving to a new platform isn't something I wanted. I have a little over 400 games for the PS4, over 140 for PS3, and a 100Gallon tote of PS2 games.For Original Xbox I have Halo, & Halo 2 for the Xbox 360, Halo Reach.Why order so many?Most of my friends are using PlayStation as their sole game platform. ""like me.""If I'm moving to a new platform, I'm bringing a few friends with me with me.-Friends from yesteryears who've since moved all over the country and started families.-We might not have a lot of time to play now, but~""Gaming with old friends is as close as it gets to hanging out at the park together as adults w/o airfare.""The ReviewPerformanceThe overall responsiveness of this system is great.Most games load in under 2 seconds, and multitasking doesn't bog the unit down.The UpgradesIt has upgradable storage either via a proprietary external expansion slot, or for the less faint of heart;~~It comes with a internal 1TB internal 20x42 M.2 PCIE SSD. If your Xbox is out of Warranty, or you don't care about that sort of thing. It's easily changed or even modded to take a full size 22x80 or 22x110 M.2 cards.-A little technical know how never hurts.**Be informed: The M.2 is uses PCIE gen 4. Gen 4 is backwards compatible with Gen 3 & will work****There can be speed variations, but just think of it as you GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR**~Not all chips behave the same.  (LTT might have a breakdown)SubscriptionsThere are a few types of subscriptions now for Xbox of varying prices.They can get rather expensive and cost almost half as much as the console per year.-Everything is subscription these days.""I'm sure it won't be long b4 we need a subscription for the brakes to work in our cars""The Ultimate pass seems to be the best as it lets you access the EA and Microsoft games libraries of games to play for one monthly price.-Great for someone like me who has next to Zero Xbox games.*Ultimate Pass also gives you the ability to stream or play games on a PC or Mobile devices.*TBH: The subscription model and little time I play, might leave this a paper weight collecting dust on a shelf.My state charges taxes on Digital goods. So, a yearly subscription will cost just over $200.The ControllerOne thing I wish Microsoft would address is their HORRIBLE controller design.  -1 StarNot that the controller is all bad. In fact it's considerably more durable than the DS4 controller.-I've literally twisted DS4 controllers in half while gaming, and the way my hands hardly can hold the Xbox controller, it feels like it would just slip out during any intense game sessions.-I've absolutely hated these controllers since day one and still to this day.""Maybe It'll grow on me this time?""--Side noteSomeone make  a controller for people with XXL large hands."
1223,Nora,2022,1,"It's no good, machine turns off many times while in game, my internet is excellent and it's wired but the Xbox is really bad. It's really frustrating."
1224,Vik,2020,2,This product isn’t that great. The hype is too much for this. It’s the same as basically all of the other ones Microsoft has made. Save your money!
1225,Brett England,2022,1,"I never got to enjoy my Series X because it is not possible to setup the device using the xbox app on an iphone 13 pro because the app crashes when you hit ""next"" after entering your username to login."
1226,Jack Ryder,2023,3,"The game system has amazing features but…the Blu Ray Player is NOT up to par with the Xbox One S.  It will recognize a 3D TV and will play DVDs, Blu Rays, UHD discs, and 3D discs.  As a system, the One S will play 3D games with no issues.  I didn’t know any of these differences until I almost purchased the X and I’m glad I found them out in time.  The 3D thing is important to me so it became a deal breaker for me.  Most others won’t mine but if 3D is important to you, the One S is the way to go."
1227,Aaron Hills,2022,5,Works like a charm and records game clips in high resolution you need to tinker with the setting to get it just right but overall a great quality gaming console.
1228,Ty,2022,1,Buyer beware don't buy the Xbox series X. There's a chance that it will not play video games.600 Dollars for a broken console.
1229,J Watson ,2022,1,Brand new Xbox series x would not turn on right out of the box. Contacted Microsoft and could not help me. Very crappy purchase
1230,Argenys Herrera,2022,5,Having a Series X with gamepass is a magical experience. Having access to so many good games at amazing quality including many upgraded older titles. Combined with quick resume I'm able to jugle between a handful of titles at a time seamlessly. Easily the best console I've had and I've been gaming since the NES.
1231,Amazon Customer,2022,1,Item was deliver unused condition without original packaging. One layer of bubble wrap. Hopefully I can return.
1232,leb199,2021,2,This item was labeled as new and it was not new.
1233,David Feudale,2022,5,"I have been with Xbox since the OG model launched back in 2001 and to say that it changed my gaming life would be an understatement. The newest iteration of Xbox is simply put, the best yet.Microsoft really stumbled throughout most of the last generation but have mostly fixed all of their mistakes this time around. For the 1st time in years I am super excited to see what the team at Xbox has in store for us!Once we finally get some more of these games they've been teasing I'll be even happier. But as far as hardware goes, this console is a beast. Gone are the days of long loading times - I typically would browse my phone during loading screens, but that's a thing of the past! I was in awe of how quickly games loading between cur scenes and the like. It's truly a next gen experience.For anyone in the fence or waiting to buy a PS5 instead - you're doing yourself an injustice not to pick this bad boy up. With cutting edge hardware, 4 generations of games, and new games continually dropping on Game Pass you won't be disappointed!"
1234,Ryan,2021,1,Got the Xbox the other day and lo and behold the power supply issues that were reported on LAST YEAR are still happening. My Xbox is dead out of the box and Microsoft wants me to send it in for repair.At this point in time I can not give a good review because of this reason.
1235,DoggyDog420,2020,1,Broken out of the box and no way to talk to anyone to troubleshoot it. This world is a mess if you need customer service these days. There’s no one there to help. Will be returning. Pretty worthless if you can’t connect a controller.
1236,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"Switching from Xbox 1X. First game I played was Cyberpunk 2077. I tried playing it on my 1X and it was quite difficult due to long load times and the bugginess of the game. While the Series X didn’t fix the bugs, the load times where like nothing! With the “quick resume” I went from Home Screen to playing in about 15 seconds (probably 5 minutes on the 1X). Currently playing The Quarry and the game is absolutely beautiful! The performance jump is very noticeable and am extremely happy with the purchase.With the low availability of the Series X (and PS5) I really appreciate being able to join the waitlist on Amazon. Not sure if I was just lucky, but I got accepted to buy within 2 weeks of joining the waitlist for the series X (still waiting a month for the PS5)"
1237,PATRICK,2021,1,"Paid for new extra XBox, and recieved the used one with missing parts. Only thing recieved in the box was xbox. All the seals werw broken and other accessories were missing. Just a waste of time and money. Now have to go through hassle of returning ."
1238,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Xbox is a major upgrade from previous generation. The 4K makes a big difference
1239,SHAE,2020,1,My series X keeps crashing after a few mins of being turned on. I can just power it up and let it sit and it will power off completely without notice. Basically I have a very expensive paper weight! Smh!
1240,Connor,2022,1,Controllers constantly disconnecting even when plugged in directly. Seems like it’s been a known issue for over a year now and Microsoft continues to sell these consoles which is disappointing
1241,Double Action,2022,4,"I like the Xbox Series X just don’t care for the buggy OS.  The OS has been bad since 2013, I don’t know why MS still shares the same OS with all the Xbox One consoles.  They need to be separated.  Games don’t launch, random crashes, multitasking crashes the game (Spotify/gaming).  All this could be fix if the Series S/X had its own OS and leave the Xbox One, S, and X with the current one.  I never have any problems with my PS5, never crashes…just plays.  The Xbox Series X is a good console just buggy."
1242,Mike D,2021,1,1 star for delivering the product as advertised. -4 stars for price gouging and buying up all the stock so people can't buy the product at MSRP.
1243,Michelle M,2022,4,"If there was ever a company that needed to beg for forgiveness after the last generation of consoles, it was Microsoft. While I did consider the Xbox One the more graphically impressive between it and the PS4, the systems user-friendliness was about as easy as a calculus test. In fact, if your internet went down for some reason, you were the proud owner of $500 blu-ray player. Unless you chose not to download the blu-ray, then you owned a huge black box.For the Xbox Series X, Microsoft makes a bunch of noticeable improvements. First is the installation. Installing this console is much less time consuming and is surprisingly small in size (1.2gb). However, the reason this is is because the console is already pretty much installed with its programming, which takes up a huge 200gb’s of the terabyte hard drive, so that’s a bit of a bummer. Another interesting update is updating the controller after installation, which is a bit odd.However, one huge improvement is the passkey feature, which allows you to login to the console without internet. Obviously, you’ll still need internet to install any digital games and some physical games do require you to be connected to the internet to finish the installations. For instance, Red Dead Redemption 2 will show as complete but you’ll need to be online to open the game the first time, but the game can be opened offline after that.Graphically, the console is great and all of the games have run smoothly so far without a hitch, both new and old. For instance, Red Dead Redemption 2, which was like a frame rate nightmare at times on Xbox One X, even with patches, runs smoothly with just the physical installation and looks better. Then there is the new version of Flight Simulator, which looks fantastic.If there is one element to this console that keeps it out of the five star range, it’s the interface, which is remarkably unchanged from the Xbox One. In fact, if you were to walk into the room without seeing the console itself, you might actually think you were still playing the Xbox One. Navigating through menus is still difficult and it’s easy to forget where certain selections and features are. Granted this is not new, Microsoft has always sacrificed simplicity with cool looks dating back to the original Xbox.Also, you still have to install the Blu-Ray player app. I know that’s a small thing, but the fact that this extremely expensive console can’t play movies by default is a bit insulting. Especially considering the amount of money it takes just to buy the dang thing.So overall, a vast improvement over every version of the Xbox One. While there are certain details that could use improvement, unlike the Xbox One, there is no shame in saying you have a Microsoft console this time."
1244,Janada  Lambert,2022,5,"Amazing console! Quiet, fast, great backwards compatibility and so much more."
1245,Big John,2022,1,Takes to long to start daily. Too many passwords and sign ons. Crap!
1246,Douglas A. Morrissett,2022,5,"So I liked my xbox one, and this is very much upgraded xbox one, Features include overall faster disk drive for game installation, fully backward compatible with every game in my sizable game library xbox 360, xbox one and series x/s, even xbox one and series x controllers making finding controllers much easier."
1247,Potato,2022,5,As a PC builder and PC Master Race preacher this is a great device! You can't build a PC that performs this good for the same price! Both the PS5 and Xbox Series X are solid purchases. I simply went this Xbox route because of controller preference and being a Halo fan boy. Also let's not forget the Xbox has that 2 extra teraflops of GPU power and a little more SSD memory. I purchased this item 2022 after prices/availability relaxed at MSRP.
1248,Oscar Lands Samano,2022,5,Item prime! The packaging was immensely graceful. Delivery was remarkably speedy. Immensely pleased.
1249,Caleb Valdez,2022,5,It arrived before the date and pristine conditionOverall happy customer
1250,William Capers,2022,1,No power cord did not work with  my own power cord  sales disater
1251,Sean Montgomery,2020,1,Well got it on launch day. Suffered a few random turn offs. Ended up putting 30 hours into ac valhalla and then boom. The series x shut down and won't turn back on. Looks like this is an issue with quite a few of them.
1252,Susan Spady,2021,2,Remote quit working after warranty was over.
1253,HT fanatic,2022,4,"I walked into the store a few weeks ago with no intention of buying a new console and walked out with an SX that wasn’t spoken for. I’m still surprised at how easy it was.The SX is noticeably faster than the One X. Auto HDR is good but doesn’t work on every game. FPS boost is good but works on even less games than Auto HDR. Quick Resume is revolutionary but buggy and unreliable and again, doesn’t work on every game. Boosted rez, 120hz and VRR, and framerate are great but RT is a bit overrated. I’m very happy that my Xbox One controllers are forward compatible on the SX.My biggest issue is that the SX doesn’t “feel” next generation. Everything from the UI, the “new” controller, to the gen 9 games themselves don’t feel particularly next level over the One X. The SX feels like an iteration of the One X instead of a next level console. It’s sort of like owning a 991 then buying a 991.2. Sure it’s a new car with slightly better interior and updated body and faster performance but the hard points are the same and isn’t nearly as big a jump as moving from the 991 to the 992.I get that we are at the point of diminishing returns. I recall getting an SNES, popping in Super Mario World, and knowing on the spot that this was a next level game on a next gen console that looked and played better than Super Mario Bros. 1-3. I know that ain’t happening again but as good as the SX is, I can’t help but feel a twinge of disappointment and I’m happy that I didn’t go through the hassle of preordering, calling every store in the area, madly pounding refresh on the computer for hours, or bribing a store employee for a console that does not astound me out of the gate"
1254,Ja,2022,5,Love this console. Amazing graphics and blazing fast.
1255,sara,2022,1,"We get the no signal defect, tried the hard reset with no luck. I am hoping for a new one."
1256,Daniel Head,2021,1,The xbox series x upon use freezes and crashes in minutes. Troubleshooting failed.Microsoft and Amazon have instructed me to get a replacement from seller.Very disappointing. Paid double for a faulty system. Now have to wait on replacement. Lets pray the 2nd time is the charm...
1257,Michael J. Caboose,2022,4,"I purchase this product from a physical retailer, not Amazon. Your mileage may vary.The Series X is a very solid console. It has addressed almost all of the shortcomings of the previous generation Microsoft consoles, with minor exceptions. It loads far faster thanks to the integrated Solid State storage combined with Microsoft's Xbox Velocity architecture.Performance has been improved across the board, with up to 4k and up to 120 fps in all modern launches and even having these features added to past titles as old as the original Xbox through Backwards Compatibility and FPS Boost.Features like 1440p support and VRR/Freesync support put the Series X above the competition, which at the time of writing and at the time of launch don't/didn't have these features. VRR is by no means mandatory, but it is helpful in games that allow variable or unlocked frame rates or that have optimization issues such as Fromsoft's latest release.The console gets warm, but it stays incredibly quiet at all times. The disk drive is far louder than the fans, and with the recent addition of Night Mode, the console and controllers can be completely incognito even when in use by turning off their built-in LED lights.Overall, definitely a swing and a home run from Microsoft. If you're gaming on the previous gen, struggling to find modern PC hardware for an affordable price, or simply interested in getting into the world of Game Pass (another excellent deal from Microsoft), the Series X is for you."
1258,Greg,2022,5,I got mine when it first came out. I have not had any problems with it. FPS Boost is a really cool feature too as it will boost the FPS of some games to 60 FPS that would otherwise stayed at 30 FPS.
1259,Amazon Customer,2020,1,Box came in good condition. Not happy with this new box. It’s very aggravating that I can’t play for hrs with out this thing freezing and shutting off. Xbox you guys hyped this up and so far it’s a complete Disappointment
1260,Jocelyn Rodriguez,2020,1,"Ewww i cant believe i acctually got this , its heavy and slow and is not worth it!! I honestly just threw it away could not handle this"
1261,NICHOLAS A OREY,2021,1,"I waited too long to return, my xbox series x overheats and shuts down constantly. I have down everything they say to do. I have turn d it in its side, plugged it into be wall directly and did a factory reset.  Don't buy this console yet. Wait until the bugs are out"
1262,Elizabeth Thornton,2022,5,Boyfriend loved.
1263,T-Bone,2022,5,"I like the ability to game at 4K 120 hertz. My OLED does not support Dolby vision at that refresh rate. But the gaming is smooth with variable refresh rate option.  So the graphics really are spectacular compared to the Xbox One S that I also have.The Xbox series X quick resume feature is unbelievable. I was playing my series X for about a month. Then I went to another TV to play the one s. It was like watching paint dry just to load the game, or a checkpoint.I've had series X since may 2021. I just happen to get lucky to get one at $499.Highly recommend getting game pass the ultimate version. Look for the specials. But don't pay full price for the ultimate Game pass :)"
1264,James,2020,1,The xbox series x is a great system but my controller is defective when plugged into a headset my xbox friends say it creates a static sound. I tested my old controllers and have no issues. It only happens on this “new” controller. It already has joystick drift too. Wish I could be sent a replacement.
1265,The Du,2020,1,Release day. Power cord doesn’t event work. Power cycles on and off for 3 seconds. Used old power cord and it works fine.Garbage.
1266,Brenndan Wulforst,2022,5,Heads up best buy has inventory no invite required I bought one from best buy before I even heard back about the invite status works absolutely fantastic recommend halo infinite
1267,Chris Stewart,2020,1,"Console bricked in less than 5 hours, already have it on its way to MS for replacement. Truly “Next Gen” 😂"
1268,josh Rosenblatt,2020,1,Worked for 1 day. Then it shutdown and never turned on again.  Already sent it back to Microsoft for replacement.  We will see how long that takes...
1269,Edward V. Hawk,2022,5,"So for starters, this is a review of the actual Series X, not about the scalper prices.I got mine for MSRP.With that out of the way, this thing is incredible. Backwards compatible with ALL XBOX console games, XBOX, XBOX 360, XBOX ONE, yep, ALL OF THEM.And many of those games benefit from having HDR, and 4k upscaling. It really does breathe new life into old games. This also means you can buy older xbox or 360 games for super cheap at used games stores, and have a blast. Maybe games you didn't buy because they were too expensive. Now, you can.The Gamepass subscription service is unbeatable. PS5 doesn't have anything EVEN CLOSE. Neither does Switch. It sets this console head and shoulders above the competition. Unless you want some specific PS5 exclusives (which is absolutely valid, they have some bangers), the Series X is the clear winner. It's also quite a bit more compact than the PS5, the PS5 is gigantic compared to this thing.One thing you'll have to remember; if you don't have a 4k 120hz TV? You won't be getting the most out of this. If you have a 1080p television, save yourself some money, and buy a Series S.But if you DO have a 4k 120hz TV, it's a game changer (no pun). It feels next gen. Forza Horizon 5 graphics are incredible for a console. MS Flight Simulator looks about 96% as good on the Series X, as it does on a $3000 gaming rig. Yes, really.The instant resume feature is killer. Playing a game but your girlfriend wants to watch a movie with you? No waiting to get to a save point, flip over to Netflix, watch a movie, flip back over to the game, and you're right where you left off.Cons: Internal storage seems huge at 1TB, but with Gamepass, you'll want to get the additional 1TB storage card.You can also use an external hard drive, BUT - and this is key, YOU CANNOT RUN GAMES FROM THE EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE. You can only run them from the 1TB expansion card. Honestly I will probably buy the 2TB expansion card when it comes out. Game Pass will use a lot of storage.The controller it comes with is excellent, but I have had issues with it disconnecting occasionally. It's not a big deal with a lot of games, but if you're say, racing online, it's a problem. I have read that repairing the controller sorts this issue, so I'll try that.Conclusion:I've owned a Series X for about a year, and I couldn't be happier with it. I still might get a PS5, because of some of their excellent exclusives, but the Series X is an absolute STEAL - if you can find one."
1270,Pepe Laporga,2022,5,"Much quieter system than PS5 which has a loud fan and coil whine, the controller fits more comfortably in my hands compared to PS5. I traded in my PS5 towards a series x and have 3 years of gamepass."
1271,Trenton,2021,1,You get the product pretty quick. They just charge more than it is worth. Unless you really want the product it isn’t worth the mark up on price.
1272,Marlon B. Hamilton,2022,5,It took me 2 years to get a Xbox series x  all acess.  But love it. Just got it last Thursday.  Worth the wait.
1273,Lawrence B.,2022,1,If you want to restart a game it requires resetting console expansion is horribly overpriced. Ill be going back to onx x
1274,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"Yep lots of em in here, Will post negative stuff even if its positive"
1275,Joel McGee,2022,4,"Well I finally got my hands on a Series X a week ago. I thought I'd give my overall thoughts on what I of how I felt about the console. I decided to break it down into sections for readability.DesignWhile it shares much of the design language of the Xbox One S and X, the Series X is decidedly larger and heavier. It looks like a mini tower PC but still maintains that utilitarian design of its predecessors. It somehow is both imposing and minimalist at the same time. I like that the exhaust is more out of the way and the front USB port is more accessible than previous models, but some might struggle to fit it comfortably into their setup. It won't win any awards for originality, but in my opinion, it's the best looking Xbox since the 360 slim.Operating systemIf you've used an Xbox One in the past 5 years or so, you should be instantly familiar with with GUI. While it cab be a bit much to take in if you've never used it, you should be navigating around the menus with ease after a day or so. There are options that are a little too buried for my liking, but Microsoft is constantly updating the OS, so it may change if enough people complain.ControllerUnlike Sony, Microsoft has keep the basic controller design intact since 2013 with the Xbox One, and even that wasn't that big of a redesign of the 360 controller. What has changed is mostly minor, the micro USB port is now a USB C port, a share button has been added, the d-pad has been redesigned, and some texture was added for better grip. It also maintains the improvements from the last gen mid cycle upgrade including a headphone jack and Bluetooth. Some may be disappointed that it still uses AA batteries, but the argument could be made that it gives the controller more longevity and flexibility. Regardless, these minor changes will likely not sway anyone who had strong opinions either way.CapabilitiesAs someone who up until last week was using an Xbox One S, I was really hoping to see a substantial leap. I can't say my mind was blown. In many ways, the Series X feels like a natural evolution. The big thing to understand with that statement is, everything I have access to was built on last generation technology, so I can't really see the full potential just yet. I will say that the upgraded games that I did try looked substantially better. I felt Gears 5 and Doom Eternal looked and ran substantially better. Borderlands 3 was never a looker, but loading in 1 minute instead of 5, with a smooth framerate made it much more enjoyable. Forza Horizon 4 and Ori and the Will of the Wisps failed to impress though. The most impressive aspect of non-optimized games are the auto HDR and the framerate boost. Gears of War 2 and Forza Horizon 1 may show their age but on Series X, they're surprisingly modern looking for such old games. The point that I'm making is, the hardware is incredibly capable and the potential is there, I just feel like we need to wait a bit longer to truly see it.GamesIt's no secret that these new consoles are hard to come by and developers have been slow to switch over to current gen games. That doesn't mean there haven't been some games to play, just that they're almost entirely games you could have played on your Xbox One with worse performance. Some good examples of games that show off what the console is capable of today are Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, Flight Simulator, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, Dying Light 2, and The Medium. I'm not personally recommending games, just saying that these are as ""next gen"" as we can get on the Series X. I suppose that may be disappointing to read, but you really are buying this console for its potential, not its current offerings. If Microsoft can put those recently purchased studios to good use, the Series X will be a powerhouse.Odds and endsI just wanted to throw in a few little bits of information. Most people are already aware of these facts, but it doesn't hurt to include in in the review. Yes, the console is fully backwards compatible with all games that are on the Xbox One, this includes backwards compatible Xbox 360 and original Xbox games, you'll also get the One X enhancements on any game that had it previously.The Xbox One was great for media and so is the Series X. You're still getting the same playback options including CD's (an odd omission from the Playstation) DVD's, and both standard and UHD Blu ray's. It's also got a fairly capable media player app.Nearly every accessory from the Xbox one is compatible including Xbox One controllers, and arcade sticks. The Kinect however, is not compatible, even with the USB adapter.  You're also losing the HDMI in port and toslink (sometimes called SPIDIF or optical); neither one was particularly useful to me personally, but your millage may vary.In terms of storage, you can bring over any compatible USB hard drive, but you won't be able to play Series X/S optimized games off of those drives, they're too slow. I thought this was common knowledge but I've seen reviews of Xbox branded hard drives getting 1 star reviews because people didn't realize this. You'll need the expensive SSD cards sold by Microsoft to play those games. Alternatively, you can just move games between an external drive and the internal storage. It's a pain to move games, but it's a good solution until you can save up the money.Overall thoughtsThe Series X ultimately feels like getting a new PC. The same games are there, but many now have a fresh coat of paint. If you're upgrading from a Xbox One and have an external drive, the process is seamless, it even uses the same cables. And while it isn't this fully fleshed out ""next gen"" experience, even a year later, it has the potential to be. Recommended."

F_U Scalpers! <3What you need to know, People still not selling at original retail.. 499.99 USD with 50$ from Microsoft warranty added separately, Paying 750.00 Dollars and beyond is just a waste (your better off building a PC at that point)(HDMI FEAT)My Series X does play @ 640x480p/1080P/1440p 60/120hz and also can play 4k UHD at 60/120Hz (if your tv or monitor can support HDMI 2.1)For people wondering if you have a monitor that's 4k 100hz+  (this is only achievable threw DisplayPort NOT HDMI) although my monitor is the new 27'' Ultra Gear UHD Nano IPS 1ms 144Hz HDR600 Monitor with G-SYNC Compatibility this can also achieve 160hz with the Overclock setting prebuilt into the monitor (DisplayPort only)  and also get 4k/60hz on HDMI on my series X and 120hz on HDMI even it if it says (60Hz) on HDMI on my pc with custom settings, I wish Xbox could detect the difference between a TV and a gaming monitor.  I guess where going to have to wait till the DisplayPort on all TV's are common on the Next batch of Newer gen Xboxes when this gets fazed out.As far as the ports in the back there is NO optical digital out!THIS is not available! I had to say goodbye to my Astro a50 wireless headphones with the base after enjoying them over the years and got my new Stealth 700 Gen 2 Headset for Xbox Series X at a reasonable price. (BE WARNED < MAKE SURE YOUR HEADSET IS COMPATABLE)I have Gigabit internet so my Xbox can do 1.2Gb down and 1.1 Gb up (Verizon isp) check them out!  and the downloads are anywhere between 680mbps-800mbps when downloading Halo 5 or Master Chief Collection as a Base Test,""Yes...

NO .. its to over priced 220$ can get you a better storage device for games you don't play often, so I recommend you keep the games you play installed and keep your library short and sweet."
1279,Jake Marut,2021,1,Every X/S game I download and try to play it crashes my xbox. This is because the xbox has a bad hardrive. I don’t know if he knew this or not but I would like answers.
1280,Jhen,2021,1,"Mine broke down about a month since it was delivered, called the manufacture good thing they sent me a new one asap but still it took about a week! The fact that it's expensive and broken for only a month I'd give it a one star!"
1281,TeamKnapsack,2022,3,"Basically an Xbox one, in a more awkward shape, with slightly better graphics. It's great if you don't already have an Xbone but right now, the technology isn't being pushed to its limits. My biggest problem isn't with the hardware itself though, it's with the bad selection of Game Pass games, compared to the Playstation alternatives. All in all, as someone that's upgraded months ago, I don't see any real incentive to upgrade, aside from petty bragging rights."
1282,JPShadowMan,2022,5,"The Xbox series X is one beast of a console. It's as close to PC gaming as I have experienced with consoles, and I'm mostly a PC gamer. The fact that you can play Xbox original, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox series X games on one console is doing what PlayStation and Nintendon't. And, given that Microsoft is gobbling up the biggest and the best video game studios, it's a no-brainer for me when making a decision on which console to buy."
1283,Cameron,2020,1,First batch has tons of hardware issues apparently. Mine randomly shuts off while running games / apps. I would not buy until Microsoft fixes this terrible first release
1284,Turner Scott,2022,1,Bad Product

1286,Devon,2020,1,"I got it Super late when I preordered it Since September and when I got it The Xbox Series X has a WiFi Problem Lagging in Multiplayer games, Basically Making it unplayable Didn’t have this problem when using Xbox One. I guess I got it too Early.🤦🏾‍♂️"
1287,Chris Rice,2022,5,"Comparison story: I've owned at one model of every generation of Xbox since the original with the previous one being an Xbox One S. I'd been playing Forza Horizon 5 on the One S connected to my 4K TV since November. The graphics were pretty good but the startup and load times were horrible. I could do tasks in other rooms while waiting for racing events to load. Then my Xbox Series X arrived this week.After downloading a system update and then Forza, I was ready to see the difference. Blown out of my mind. Startup and load times are so fast they are practically not noticeable. Combine that with the ability to do 'quick resume' for previously loaded games, and you can be playing in no time at all. Now I barely have time to see if there are any messages on my phone, let alone go do some task in another room. And the graphics are out of this world. In Forza if I stop at a field of flowers and I see that each flower has petals. Flamingos at the waterfall have feathers. Pineapple plants have serrated edges. Banana plants have tears and holes in the leaves. Pros: Amazing graphics and speed Smaller than a PS5Negatives:- Storage of 1TB (which is even smaller due to system files) Games that are designed specifically for the Series S/X must be stored on the internal drive or an expensive proprietary Seagate external drive. But games can be moved to an external HDD or SSD if you aren't planning on playing it for a while.- Seems to consume more power than my One S. Running my TV, surround sound and Xbox through a UPS and 500-watt power transformer, the transformer could not handle the load when gaming on the Xbox Series X while it could easily handle it on the One S.Conclusion: If you can find one at MSRP prices, this should be a no-brainer of a decision for any gamer."
1288,Marshall Burton,2021,1,"Just be careful who you buy from. My ""Xbox"" was bricked almost out the box and the seller was less than helpful beyond quoting a warranty that didn't even register to an Xbox Series X."

1294,Fresno,2021,4,"Contrary to what most people are saying all XBox games are NOT compatible with the Series X/S… Only ALL XBox One games are compatible (in theory)….and only a relatively small number of XBox 360 games are compatible… not really sure if any original Xbox games are compatible, but if so it is definitely a subset as well.  Make sure to do some research because the number of games is significantly less than advertised.  Also, XBox 360 controllers are NOT compatible with the Series X/S.Otherwise a solid system overall.  I think the Series X is a better buy than the Series S simply due to the 4K and overall power of the system…even if you don’t have 4K, you’ll have a smoother ride with the X since it will have far greater longevity… eventually they will push the limits of the hardware, so the Series S will not be able to keep up as well.  Plus you can buy used XBox One game discs and pkay them on the system wuth updated graphics."

1301,Richard in St. Paul,2021,4,"This XSX is one quiet, elegant black box, possibly the least obtrusive and best behaved technology I’ve owned in decades of computing and gaming going back to the TRS-80 and Commodore VIC-20. I jumped ship from Sony for it and haven’t looked back.For me, these are the strengths separating it in mid-2021 from the PS5:Functionally silentClassic modernist design of “less is more”Nearly invisible in a darkened room for nighttime gamingI sit six to seven feet from the unit while playing and am simply never aware it is on. That, in my sound-sensitive universe, is sheer brilliance. Could it be prettier, flashier? If that motivates you then look to the PS5, with its flair for being noticed; I wanted a machine with the DNA of a tongueless ghost. A machine for an adult who no longer thinks much of flashy plastic or the fans blasting inside it.Reason for four stars: the loud clacking new controller design, which makes the sound of crickets being ground to dust on a disco floor. Whoops. Microsoft giveth with one hand, taketh with the other! But no worries: new old stock XBox One controllers FTW.So, one serene machine. It’s ideal for 4K gaming as well as streaming fights on DAZN and classic Twilight Zone on HULU. Even as PS5 owners fret about noisy fans, I could simply not be happier with this console from a performance perspective. Note to Sony: come up with something as refined as the XSX in your next product refresh and we’ll talk. There’s room on my desk for more stuff, as long as it’s made with love and care."
1302,Jrrp,2021,1,"This was the biggest mistake of 2021, this consol it's terrible, got one and had to send it back to Microsoft."
1303,JoelDT,2023,1,"The Xbox branch of Microsoft has been dabbling with 512gb and 1tb storage options since the Xbox 360 days and into the Xbox one days, that is pushing now almost 2 decades old stuck in this storage capacity. While an expansion slot is available. The onboard storage is outdated in terms of size, but blazing fast with speed. The graphics and cpu while powerful all becomes undone by very low storage capacity and constantly needing to transfer larger and larger files usually done via Downloads while ISPs institute data caps. You can try buying an external hard drive but you will need to transfer the games back and fourth as Xbox has made it impossible to play off external drives. Making their expansion slot the only go to option. Hence bringing about yet another monopoly from Microsoft. While some have said powered drives can achieve external gameplay I’ve yet to find one. This next gen storage given todays game sizes should be at a minimum 5 Tb. It’s time to get with the times and give gamers the storage they need to own and store their games and not keep hard drive space low in order to push a useless and never viable cloud service."
1304,mikes,2022,1,Exactly the headline.
1305,Kristin M. Burnett,2022,1,"I was on a waiting list to order an Xbox series X.  In October I received an email giving me 24 hours to order the product if I still wanted one.  So I ordered it for my children for Christmas.  I wrapped it immediately so they wouldn’t see.  When they opened their gift today, they were so excited.  When they opened the actual box they found A VERY USED XBOX ONE.  No cords or controllers.  Just an ugly, used Xbox one.  I’m so disappointed.  $500 is a lot of money and we budgeted for this one great gift for our children…only for a massively disappointing Christmas morning.  I’m so very upset.  I started the return process but an exchange was not offered. I would love an explanation as to how this could happen."
1306,Bjornie Herjolfson,2023,1,"Xbox series x will not play physical games.  All games must be downloaded from internet. You can't install a game from disk, not even games specifically for the xbox series x.  The disk becomes unusable on it's own.  Nothing but a license code.  For more detail go to youtube and look up ""The Xbox Series X has a big DRM problem | MVG""It's a shame.  Microsoft was once the consumer friendly newcomer.  Now they're they're the little tyrants of the video game world.  I'll never buy another xbox, and I'll only buy xbox exclusives for this one.

1311,Jacob ,2022,1,Crashes every time you load up a game
1312,thetraveler333,2022,1,"I have owned mine for about 8 months. A couple of months ago, the problems started. It wouldn't read some game discs at all. Now it is worse than ever and only about half of all discs work. If you do some research online, you will learn this is an epidemic. It is not a one in a million problem. I know quite a bit about software, hardware and even some programming. It is hard for me to be believe this is a hardware issue and not software. If it's software, that makes me wonder if it is being done on purpose in order to force you to download games direclty from them. Instead of using gamefly for instance. And so much for a friend bringing a game disc over for you to play.You would think I would have learned my lesson after going through 2 xbox 360's due to the red ring of death. I will NEVER buy another microsoft product after this. I should have went with my first instinct and bought a playstation. My atari 2600 I bought in 1978 worked just fine. Put in a cartridge and it played. End of story. Today? They can't even pull that off. And this is progress??? Consider this your warning. Read the history of how MS handled the red ring of death fiasco. It took them years to admit how widespread the problem was. It WILL be the same with the disc problems on the new xbox."
1313,Dwaynebank,2022,5,Amazing graphics. Xbox gamepass feels like unlimited content with games constantly being added. My wife was annoyed when I pulled the trigger on this but now she agrees it's one of the best purchases we've ever made.
1314,MA,2021,1,"We knew it was coming without the original box, but we got the console without any protection!We returned it."
1315,Cameron Hendricks,2020,1,I disliked that I played it for a few weeks and now i am sending it back to be looked at / repaired because there seems to be a Graphic Card issue inside the Xbox
1316,Elgrandavidp,2022,5,"After skipping XB One and sticking to PC, its great to be back on a console. I was fortunate to pick one up on day one and it's been a great console. The gamepass ecosystem has been a great value. I know most games have been upgraded last gen, but they look great. I'm looking forward to the full next gen lineup!"
1317,Ryan M,2020,5,"Amazing.  I held out on the One X because there had been whispers of this next gen console for several years, so I figured I would just go all in whenever it came out.  I was one of the fortunate few who were able to snag a pre order, and I have been playing daily since launch.  The performance is unbelievable.  There obviously isn't much in the way of Series X games yet, but I have been catching up on some Xbox One games I haven't played, notably Doom Eternal and Control so far.  If those are considered last gen games running on the Series X, I can't imagine how games could look or perform much better.  They look incredibly great, and load times are basically non-existent.  It's just a joy playing.Packaging and set up really feel top notch.  They went over the top with the packaging, it feels really nice opening.  Set up is very easy too, similar to setting up a google product.  You do it all through your phone, and it is very easy and painless.  I was worried when there were reports of it ""running hot like a furnace"" pre launch, but those reports are pretty laughable.  It doesn't get any hotter than any other console I've had, and it actually probably runs much cooler than my old OG Xbox 360 that bit the dust a while back.  The great thing that you wont notice as well, is that it is super quiet.  The only time I hear it is when its whirring whenever I power it on.The only minor negatives I have are that it is big, and IMO a little ugly.  However it is smaller and I think better looking than the PS5.  I have it set up horizontally on my entertainment center, and it doesn't look quite right.  Its obviously made to be set up vertically, but I don't know anyone who puts their consoles in a vertical position, and not to mention you can't really put it in an entertainment center that way.  But when you're playing, who cares how it looks?  The other thing is that quick resume is finicky.  It doesn't work ALL the time, but when it does it's amazing.  You can literally power on the console, and you're playing exactly where you left off last time in about 30 seconds.  I also wish there were an SPDIF out for my AV receiver.If you're a gamer and deciding between the Series X or the Series S, I think in the long run the Series X is absolutely a better bet.  The main thing that scared me off on the Series S is the memory, and the lack of a disc drive.  The cost of the expandable storage is exorbitantly expensive, and the 500GB will probably fill up fast on the Series S.  If you buy the S and the proprietary storage, you're already at the cost of the Series X.  However the 1 TB on the Series X is perfect.  I currently have 13 games, between One and 360 versions, with about 50% storage remaining.  However, I'm sure future games will take some more space.  Overall, I am overly happy with this, and has made my quarantine time actually enjoyable.  Just do not buy from resellers on ebay, as I am sure more are coming available very soon."

1327,RCADavidson,2021,5,"Before I begin, while I find the Xbox Series X easier to buy than the PS5, it is no stranger to being scalped like it's Sony and Nintendo counterparts.  If you are having a hard time getting this system, please be patient and don't pay scalper prices on eBay and Amazon.Now, to start off this review, I wouldn't fight said scalpers for one reason, games.  As of now, most games coming to the system haven't had release dates yet, as far as I know, and I don't think the studios Microsoft have bought have released any details on games for the system.  However, if you're a long time Xbox player, I do think things like Game Pass and backwards compatibility offer pretty decent value for the system.  With Game Pass, it's already a great value with around a hundred games to play (and Xbox Live Gold is included), and the system is also compatible with four generations of games (with some Xbox One games having upgrades).  While not every game is compatible, I find Microsoft's way of handling backwards compatibility better than Sony's PS5, which is only compatible with PS4 and PS5 games.  Only issue with the hardware/software side is the Xbox Live Gold requirement for online play.  If you're on Game Pass, you don't have to worry since it's included, but even if other systems are doing it, it's a paywall that needs to go away.  As of writing, consumers prevented the service from going up in price, and now Gold isn't required for free-to-play title no more (like how they're not required on other systems), but an online multiplayer subscription will never be a good value unless they use dedicated servers, and let's admit this, some games still use peer-to-peer (or console-to-console).I also like the hardware Microsoft was able to create.  While people could say that the system is big, I can say as a person who built an ITX PC, I would've loved to have a case this small.  It's a sleek box that's just barely taller than two GameCubes that also ran pretty cool and quiet.  While the SSD is half the speed of the PS5's on paper, I found that the games still load rather quickly.  The one trick Xbox has vs PS5's speed is Quick Resume, which allows your games to pick up right from where you left off.  This works great when you're playing a game like Crash Bandicoot 4 and a friend invites you to a quick game online.  Just switch to that game, and when you're done, switch back, and it'll be like you never left the game.Next is the new controller, and while it isn't a massive departure from previous controllers, it's the best one Microsoft has produced.  First, let me say that if you don't like the new controller (some people do say it is a smaller than the One controller), the Xbox One controllers work just fine with the new system, which is actually pretty pro-consumer of them.  What I do like about this controller, however, is the new d-pad.  It is based off the Elite controllers, and your thumb can easily roll around on it.  The controller also has a nice textured back, which gives a bit more grip.  The only issues I have are that it's still the same Xbox controller from the Xbox One, more or less.  There is still no gyro control (which I think it needs since gyro is the closest thing consoles like PlayStation and Switch have to mouse controls) or anything like the DualSense's adaptive triggers, and why in the 2020s does a controller still use AA batteries?  I know people have strange opinions and that I can buy rechargeable batteries for the controller, which I have received as Christmas presents, but even a $50 Switch Pro alternative controller, 8BitDo's SN30 Pro+, still has gyro and a removable, rechargeable battery, but Microsoft charges $60-65 for a controller that uses AA batteries.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a fine controller, great even, but Microsoft needs to catch up with everyone else, because before long, their controllers will start to feel outdated.Overall, I think that the Xbox Series X is a great system with even greater potential.  If Microsoft can utilize the"
1328,Sean Sneer,2020,1,"Defective at launch, love it lots.:("
1329,MartinR,2021,5,"The Xbox Series X has a powerful Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), a great cooling system, and 16GB of Random Access Memory (RAM). It comes equipped with a custom AMD RDNA 2 GPU. The GPU is made up of 12 teraflops. In fact, the Xbox Series X is considered to be the most powerful console ever made. One single fan cools it, and keeps it from overheating. Specifically, the fan works in a vortex motion; therefore, it causes hot air to be blown out the top. When standing vertically the Xbox is pulling air from the bottom of the console. The Xbox comes with 16GB of GDDR6 RAM. GDDR6 is one of the fastest types of ram that you can possibly buy. To summarize, The Xbox Series X has some of the best internals for its $500 price point. It allows one to play games with a stable frame rate, and play for long periods of time without overheating."
1330,Brian Kling,2021,5,"Microsoft delivers in a huge way. 4k at 60fps is insane. 1440p at 120fps is insane. Console is lightening fast. Microsoft absolutely nailed it. Couldn’t be happier. The average reviews is 4.8 out of 5 star which is amazing considering there are thousands of 1 star reviews of people complaining about scalpers charging $1,000+"

1332,Khamani Vixama,2021,1,It keep turning off by itself and keep getting this green screen
1333,Avid Fan,2021,5,"Rap references aside, the Series X truly does feel like a culmination of Microsoft's experience and lessons learned from their previous generations of making consoles. No rocky launch or missteps here. Absolutely nothing about the Series X feels half-baked. It is a sleek, quiet and powerful system.I really appreciate that they allow the user to adjust so many settings to maximize their TV/Monitor setup. You can let the system automatically choose your output settings and be guaranteed a great picture. However, OCD tinkerers, like myself, can adjust settings such as Variable Refresh Rate, 120fps, and HDR to our liking. The user interface is easy to use but still offers advanced features - the perfect sweet spot. This all comes together to make it feel like a console designed by gamers with other gamers in mind.Some thoughts on backwards compatibility - While most gamers are always looking forward to the next hot game, many of us still like to revisit older games. Microsoft gets this and it's important. Not only do they keep these older games available, thus preserving them, but in many cases they have actually improved the game by adding features like Frame Rate Boost and Auto-HDR. They even make these features optional for those who just want to play the original, purest version of the game.Based on the quality of tech inside the Series X combined with the price point, I would have bought one even without backwards compatibility. But the fact that buying a Xbox also supports an ecosystem of game preservation is just icing on the cake."
1334,The Angry Otter,2021,5,"It's lightning fast, whisper quiet and has a larger hard drive than the PS5 (both are expandable but at $200+ for the Xbox's storage expansion a lot of people won't be buying that right away).  Quick resume for multiple games is great as well and as always Game Pass and Xbox Live are almost impossible to pass on.  Controller somehow feels even more solid than the Xbox One.That said, DO NOT BUY FROM SCALPERS and just wait on more to be available.  Faster load times aren't worth another $300+ dollars and by purchasing from a scalper you're rewarding awful ""business"" practices.  Send a message with your wallet that this isn't acceptable.I won't dock stars for this because this review is for a console, but as an aside, Microsoft, Sony, and all the retailers should be ashamed for allowing their supply to be purchased by scalpers in this capacity to begin with, but unfortunately they do not care and are laughing all the way to the bank.  The way they see it, they've made their money and the rest of us plebs can sort it out ourselves."

1336,Logan,2021,5,"Firstly, I am not an xbox enthusiast nor am I a Playstation fanboy. I just buy whatever console seems to have the better capabilities and game line-up upon release. I bought the PS4 day one and this generation I felt the Xbox series X had the best value. It's a great console and deserves 5 stars as it hasn't had any technical issues or malfunctions after having it for nearly a year. That being said, it's not some alien godsend of a gaming masterpiece. It is a solid piece of hardware that plays games at the marketed settings and does so well. For the value, if you are choosing between a mid to low range pc and this, honestly I would choose this as it is just such a good value for what it provides. However, it will never out perform any high-end rigs nor should anyone expect it to."
1337,Vikingbrute,2022,2,"Xboxseries-x is a good system but it isn't mind blowing yet..Microsoft hasn't really released any good exclusive's except the same one's halo, forza, gear's, it took them. Over a year and a half to release something from launch date..Yes game pass is cool but honestly you ether own thoe's game's or you have already played them. Best thing about game pass is day one releases...But other then that keep your Xboxone-x cause this system isn't worth it yet Xboxseries-x and ps5 are only a 1.72 difference in computational power that's not much of a difference..ps5 has released over 10 or more exclusive's since launch..And only thing different between the two is quick resume, and Dolby vision, ..So no this system isn't a power house at all...once they use the xdk2 and make only xsx native apps. Then you will see the true power it can do. But today isn't that day"
1338,Person,2021,5,"Why you may ask, well basically the only reason I've ever owned a Playstation, which I do like a lot is for it's amazing exclusives. No one can argue with it having the best! That being said the PS5 is nothing more than a glorified PS4 Pro, which i own and I'll keep until they don't support it anymore. Speaking of Pros here are the Pros and Cons of the Xbox Series, vs the PS5 and why it's much better imo.Pros.12 Teraflops as opposed to 10 tf in the PS5, many think this doesn't make a difference but for overall bandwith and graphical abilities it does make a difference.Game Pass is just a no brainer, along with my near 300 digital game collection I get over 100 that are free, with a small subscription which blows PS Now out of the water, because it's mostly all streaming (games) anyway.The graphical differences on PS4 exclusives using backwards compatibility on the PS5 is pathetic compared to the Xbox Series X. The XSX uses better texture filtering, 16x antiostropic filtering on ALL games, including enhancements from the Xbox One X (which is still a great console). So games look better, more colorful and the enhanced games just look out of this world. I tried many on the PS5 I had for a short time and could barely tell any differences. Also it uses Ps4 Pro code for all of it's games. In that case not raising the resolution at ALL on many titles. Which most had hoped for.You get 3 generations of backwards compatibility on the Series X, which I thought might not be that great and I would want new games, but it's a blast just to test them out to see how much better they look and play. Until Next gen only games arrive. Also speaking of which. The new Sony Exclusives (about 90%) will be on the PS4/Pro as well as Ps5. So what's the point?So overall the XSX just feels more premium, and looks a lot better. The PS5 is this hideous looking abomination that looks like some new building they just built in Dubai. It would be okay as a decorative piece like a vase or something. But I literally couldn't even stand to look at it sitting with my other consoles. It was immense. No I don't hate playstation but the Ps5 is by far the worst console I think they've ever made. And this could possibly be the best console Xbox/Microsoft ever make. And possibly the last, from what rumors say. So do yourself a favor, don't listen to the hype for PS5, and at this point don't bother. Wait a few years.Also with the XSX, just like the Xbox One, you can hook up ANY size external HDD to store games (an SSD external is needed to play the enhanced games) but that's no big deal Since the transfer from Ex to SSD is very very fast. With PS5 there are all sorts of issues with storage messing up, not working at all, rebuilding the database etc. Also I think the max is an 8tb hdd, also you can't use it for Media, MKV's, AVI's and such nearly as much as you can on the XSX. Which I also use for Netflix, Primes, Pluto TV, listening to MP3's and downloaded movie files etc.A couple things I don't like about the Series X, which are very few, is that the controller feels very cheap. The buttons smash in to easily, and it feels as if it could break after long periods of play. I really like the 360 controller (best ever made) and the original Xbox One controller. Which is compatible with the XSX, so if something goes wrong you can always use an old one. And sometimes it does have trouble syncing up right form the start, but that's easily rectified by hitting the button on the console.Lastly the console is whisper quiet, no issues to speak of. The PS5 I had, did seem a little quirky but not really bad, but I think more people have problems with it, and it does run much hotter. And I noticed the XSX SSD is slightly faster than the PS5's, which i found strange, but awesome at the same time. So I think this time MS may get back the crown they lost after the flop of the XB1. Which they deserve because the 360 was hands down the best console they ever had. Now it looks like the XSX is on it's way up. Maybe even the Series S will help, but imo get this, it's powerful, quiet, nice to look at and will definitely stand the test of time. Very future proof indeed. ENJOY!"

1342,Nevada,2022,1,This console is almost a year old now and you need to submit a request to even try to get your hands on it. Like I don’t care if it’s easy to do how can’t a billion dollar industry company keep up with supplies this far into the console being released. Xbox has slowed down every xbox one console making them worse then the Xbox 360. I am not a big gamer I play simple games from time to time and my Xbox one s does a horrible job and even doing the most simple things makes it an almost unplayable console.

1345,alex,2022,1,"Recently I purchases the Xbox Series X through another online retailer. Upon turning on the system I was prompted to create a XBOX Live account by providing an email which is understandable especially if you plan to play online. After completing that process, I receive another prompt requesting an additional email address or phone number for verification purposes I had an issue with that but opted to provide an additional email address. Subsequent to that, Microsoft ""requires"" you to provide your home address even for purchases with a gift card and prompts you to use biometrics(optional) for added security and verification. I turned on the Xbox Series X after 3 days of no gaming and met with a prompt stating there's an issue with my account and that I had to use the web to fix it. I thought maybe the problem was account inactivity. I sign in online and met with a DECEPTIVE prompt from Microsoft to get additional personal information(phone number) stating the account was locked for suspicious activity and that my phone number was needed for verification purposes otherwise the account would remain locked.Apart from the blatant privacy issues, Microsoft minus the fact that XBOX doesn't have many exclusive games has an ""ocassional"" issue with purchases/downloads where the games your purchase either doesnt show in your download queue or the purchase is lost. This is an issue anyone can easily verify through a simple Google search."

1349,K. Burnett,2021,5,"We've always been launch purchasers of new consoles, dating all the way back to the Ps2.  This time around I figured there wasn't a need.  I seldom play games.  My older son uses the ps4 and younger son has a proper gaming pc and pretty much dumped the xbox one.  Heard about the shortages and difficulty buying the X.  An opportunity came up and I noticed the option of going with Game Pass Ultimate, which includes the console, xbox live and a slew of games for around $36 a month.  I spend more than that for siriusxm, netflix and another streaming service combined (heck that's was week and a half's cost of beer for me until I stopped drinking).  Figured what the heck and jumped on it.  Got it set up and had the option of installing games I'd purchased on xbox, xbox 360 and xbox one (there's backwards compatibility) or a bunch of games on xbox game pass.  Installed the first game, Star Wars. Jedi Fallen Order.  It's a game about a year and a half old.  It looks amazing, even on my 1080p plasma set.  I highly recommend going the game pass route, especially if you like the Microsoft published games (since they're included).  It's going to take months to play through a handful of games accessible.  And both of my kids are all of a sudden re-interested in Xbox.  It's definitely an investment.  But well worth it.Update....Game pass ultimate adds another perk, cloud gaming.  I've linked my controller to my laptop via bluetooth and am able to play xbox games hosted on MS servers.  This only adds more to the incredible value of Game Pass Ultimate.  People piss away mad money on streaming services.  For under $40 you can get a teriffic console, xbox live and game pass.  Don't hesitate.  Go for it!!!"

1357,Nick,2021,5,"For those wondering why there's perpetual shortages of PS5/Series X, it's because the fabrication process for AMD Zen 2 CPU's are complex and slow going. AMD also supplies the chips for both console makers, and is stretched thin by the demand.For those who offer hollow comfort in the media by saying there's no exclusives for the Series X and without any new games it's not worth getting upset about. I disagree completely. Next gen consoles are the perfect time to play last gen titles on your back log. In fact, the Series X is the most perfect machine to finally get around to those games you wanted to play but felt they ran kinda janky and bad.Games like No Mans Sky, ran janky and bad. Games like Kingdom Hearts 3, ran janky and bad. Games where developers said 'F it, uncap the framerate and let it go free'. Those games, were janky and the load times were bad.There's so many back compat games that load in 1/5th the time, and hit 60FPS. Skyrim finally hits 60FPS on consoles with HDR/4k. You can scoff at how Skyrim is a PS3/360 game, but this is my point. Next gen consoles bring new life to your catalogue. New $60 AAA games with microtransactions and Games As A Service profit model isn't going to justify my purchase. Getting Blair Witch to actually hit 60FPS and avoid motion sickness justifies it.That makes waiting for these things to come into stock so painful. Because they're machines that do an amazing job looking backwards as well as forwards. Here's to hoping AMD ups their game."

1362,Paco,2021,5,"I purchased my Xbox Series X through Gamestop. I've always been a bit of a Sony fanboy, but this generation Sony's horrible storage solutions and lack of backwards compatibility led me to transition to using the Xbox as my main gaming console. I still have the PS5, but the lack of storage means I'll only be using it for exclusive titles.As for comparisons between the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, the plastics on the Xbox seem to be of higher quality, the disc drive is much quieter than the PS5, fan noise is much less than the PS5, and, even though storage is expensive, Xbox's storage solution is fantastic. The PS5 does have faster load times, and, for now, the exclusives are much better. I expect that to change once Microsoft gets rolling with their new acquisitions.Game Pass is a game changer this generation."

I can’t load up games at all and extremely slow loading times and much more issues. My friends all have the Xbox series S and the old gen  Xbox’s and all have no problems AT ALL. I spent $500 on a console that is worse than the one I replaced. Will not be buying the next xbox. In fact I’m trying to get rid of this one because now it’s bugging out so bad I have to reset my console 3 times just to load up a game. $500 I wish I spent on building a PC.

1369,WVphotog,2022,2,"If you’re wondering why it doesn’t say I purchased this item while writing my review, I bought this console off of a seller on eBay in 2021 because I was impatient to get a fairly priced Xbox, since this would have been my first one. Little did I know this would be one of the purchases in my list of ""I wish I had done more research"". To start off, I live in a semi-rural area, where I don’t have the best internet. Why am I saying that I live in a rural area? Because every time I buy a physical copy of a game and put a disk in, I have to most of the time wait a whole day (or longer) to play the game I just bought because the Xbox, before you are able to play the game, requires a download to “optimize” the game for series X. I know the gimmick of this console is quick resume and some optimization for older games, but until after I bought it I had no knowledge whatsoever that I had to do this stupid download even for new titles. The most infuriating part is if a new game is available for Xbox Series X, the marketing team will most of the time still cater toward Series S/the Xbox one, and even if it says Xbox Series X on the game case, I still have to do a long download. I can sympathize an optimization of a newer game that wasn’t originally made for the Xbox Series X, solely to allow the game to access quick resume, but for psychical games that literally have “Made for Xbox Series X” on the game case, it makes absolute no sense I still have to do a long download to be able to play. I personally like collecting digital copies since there’s a charm to it, but for the Xbox Series X, it’s 100% better just to buy from the Microsoft store on the console. Regardless of the downloads there’s still a lot of good to come out of this console. The Xbox controller for the Series X is the perfect size, and is very responsive to imputs. Even though I hate doing the optimization downloads, I still enjoy the small graphical upgrades the Xbox Series X does to enhance the visuals of old games, and especially the relatively new ones too. While playing games on the console, the games ( at least to my eyes ) consistently run 60 fps and paired with my 4K HD TV, the games look stunning. In the end, there is some gripes I have with the console, since no console is perfect, but to be able to play some of my older games with more stable fps, a good controller, and new, visually stunning games, I am quite satisfied with the console."
1370,Gary Lindenbaum,2022,1,"I had mine for less than a day and sent it back. Here’s why:1-No faster than my XBox One S2-Graphics quality not significantly better than my One S3-I was able to load 28 games onto my One S’s internal memory 1 TB. Could play additional games off my auxiliary HDD.4-The same 1 TB memory on the Series X only held 17 games and I could not play games off of my HDD. You need to buy a special SSD if you want to add more games to the Series X. Minimum cost over $2005-Some games like EverSpace and Microsoft Flight simulator wouldn’t play at all.6-Tech support clueless as to how to solve issues and you’re allowed a maximum of 2 phone calls per business day to tech support.7-Incompatible with Kinnex8-Had to log in every time I wanted to playOverall, this machine turned out not just to be an expensive disappointment, but a complete pain in the butt. Even the return process was ridiculously complicated taking over an hour on the phone because the option to arrange a return on line doesn’t exist for this machine.You want to waste over $500, but this expensive brick. Have fun with that."
1371,Cole Thompson,2022,1,"In order to play games, I need to unplug my modem, hard restart the console, or both. Every single time. Tried messing with all the settings imaginable and no luck. Words cannot express the regret I have for this purchase"
1372,Brandi Roe,2021,5,"This Xbox is so powerful, if you can find it it’s definitely worth the money !"
1373,Speed 68,2021,5,Nothing
1374,Hathus,2021,5,I love my new xbox series X.
1375,Louis,2021,5,Great upgrade
1376,Brett Noble,2021,5,"By the time I get a next generation console........ the next generation will be coming out.  What is the problem?!  If you are going to release something make sure there is enough stock, good god!"
1377,Sab,2022,1,I personally think it's ridiculous they haven't released a console laying down. The standing up version would surely ruin the CDs faster. So please release a laying down version so I can purchase that one!
1378,Jaylev,2021,5,"This is a great system. Been playing it at a friends house. Really fun and fast. Virtually no loading times. Don't get sucked into the hype and pay stupid prices, because you can't be patient. I want one of my own, but i'm gonna wait and buy it for MSRP, not $900+ and up. Just hang in there. Eventually these will be plentiful and anybody can get one anytime they like."
1379,Dustin gardlock,2022,1,Every time I turn it on I have to wait for an hour for an update and as an adult with a job and kids I don’t get much play time.. by the time I get to play it’s time to turn it off and take care of life… on top of that it already won’t read discs and even some of my downloaded games.. I shoulda got the PlayStation seriously I make this mistake every generation!!
1380,Brian Giroux,2021,5,"This console is a beast. Incredibly fast load times, 4k graphics and all makes this console a heavy hitter for next gen. Would definitely recommend. The series x runs so quiet, you'd forget it was even on. Definitely do not pass on this console."
1381,Miguelangel Chavez,2021,5,Changed my life! @.@
1382,Travis,2021,5,I’ve had this since it came out and I love it just as much as any of the other Xbox consoles I’ve had before.
1383,Rob Dukich,2021,5,"People giving 1 star reviews because of scalper prices from sellers is not a product review. I have one. Its awesome. Boots super fast. Loads games in a flash. Performance gains on older titles. Ecosystem is great. Optional game pass subscription gives you access to tons of games which means you always have games to play even on the go with cloud gaming, or stream from your console with the Xbox app without the need of game pass. 5 stars all the way."
1384,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Although an upgrade to a PS4 and XBONE are not completely necessary at this time, this console is  amazing. Since I have my One X, in the living room, and the Series X in the game room, I get to see the difference in visual quality and performance of games first hand.  I considered the PS5 but I hardly used my Ps4 and most of the games form last generation were purchased on the Xbox ecosystem so this made alot more sense. Having gamepass and back compatibility is a huge plus as well. Overall, I am so happy I bought this gaming machine. Again, you can wait a while as buying it now isn't a must just yet but ehen you do, you will appreciate the leap forward."
1385,Jeremy Roberts,2021,5,"Scalpers should be SWATed by the FBI. Product is simply amazing. Super fast load times. Crisp, clean graphics. I upgraded from the One X, to the XSX. People said there wouldn't be a big graphical difference. They were wrong. I notice a difference"
1386,Virojrat Limjumruntorn,2021,5,"I noticed earlier today that the Series S were restocked. After realizing that, I figured I’d spend the next 20 mins refreshing the Series X page. Guess what?? I was right they restocked the Series X today; the stock lasted approximately 5 mins.I STILL CAN’T BELIEVE I JUST BOUGHT SERIES X 😝"
1387,M_IT,2021,5,"Games look amazing, some awesome content to come! Halo, Fable, Doom, Starfield, Fallout - some of the best games around.Updated: They are adding Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to games!  Doesn't get better."
1388,John M. Brady,2020,5,"I received my Xbox Series X direct from Microsoft on launch day.  Two observations, it's incredibly faster than my Xbox One X and extremely quiet considering how big the cooling fan is.  The game quick start feature is similar to unpausing the game but doing it when the console is off.  One concern I did have, is that when the console is on it's side it get's incredibly hot.  Nothing happened but I moved it vertical to be proactive."
1389,Tiara,2021,5,Loved it
1390,KT,2021,3,"Its alright, could have been more powerful imo. Games look a little better but not a generation leap like other consoles have neen imo.Not to many games for it and its been nearly a year.Imo they are slowing the stock on purpose. No excuse for it anymore. Youve had time to find alternatives. Ps5 releasing a new model for more supply....you better step up your game."
1391,Trypticon,2020,5,"The Xbox Series X has better and more powerful CPU and GPU, it's more quiet, it's smaller than the PoS5 and has QuickResume, Auto HDR, can do 1440P, has lightyears better game subscription service and it can actually do 4K with 60FPS/120FPS and last but least XSX’s SDD is way way faster than the Sh!tstation 5’s  glorified HDD."
1392,Alexis Rios,2021,5,"Best console, fast, great graphics, silent. Better with Game Pass."
1393,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Got on launch day at my work it’s big works great sow far no problems with it plays all my disc games 360 Xbox one games and dvd movies
1394,Isaac Samayoa,2021,5,Wasn't expecting such an upgrade but was worth every penny
1395,Anne Cannon,2021,5,Bit of a rocky start. Took a bit to get here. But once everything was hooked up ( new LG OLED tv from Amazon) and wireless headphones. Ahhhh gaming heaven. Worth it if and when you find one :)
1396,Nolan Jorgensen,2021,5,Oh sure wish I could buy one at $499.99 but Amazon's only allowing scalpers to sell the Xbox series x I see!
1397,Lebo Smithsonian,2021,5,"The Xbox Series X, like it's predecessor, are great systems to game on. However, Amazon needs t STOP letting sellers selling it overpriced!! Not cool, man."
1398,William Lamb,2021,5,"Great Machine, Better then some high end PC's. And a lot less in price. Well unless you're buying from a scalper. Never BuY from a scalper. Chances are the machine is a brick and your money will be good bye forever."
1399,Melissa,2021,5,Omg so good a lot better then ps5
1400,M.L.,2021,3,"Not much difference between this and the  Xbox one x.  Load times are a bit faster but I cannot tell any difference between the two when actually playing a game.  Main screen and interface is almost unchanged.  So if $500 is worth having your games load a bit faster, go for it.  FYI, I don't own the new PS5 and don't intend on buying it so this is an honest review."
1401,Soozie Lee,2021,5,
1402,Edward,2022,1,Waiting months to get one is absolutely ridiculous.
1403,james s rose,2022,1,This console has an audio delay problem that makes games unplayable..stay away!!!!!! You have been warned
1404,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Beautiful design, powerful, fast and that quick resume... AWESOME!!!"
1405,K-Loy,2022,1,"Microsoft was happy to sell all of their systems on release day. They knew darn well that meant they were going to a scalper team that was then going to screw their customers.  Yet M$ didn't lift a finger to protect us. As we're going forward there's been no apologies, no attempt to fix that, no assurance that we'll do it better next time.... Instead we get hit with more ways that we have to pay more money to play the same games. Stop the madness and don't support/enable this kind of behavior by corporations."
1406,Yoal,2020,1,Dont buy
1407,David,2020,1,Scalper this product is not worth this.
1408,Customer ,2020,1,What a rip off for the price. Not worth the money.
1409,Henri,2021,3,"I know this is an amazing console, but, this jacked up price seems a bit greedy wouldn’t you agree? Oh well, I guess karma will control this one. Best of luck to the seller.. I would not  mind paying 100 extra dollars but this is absurd lol.  There aren’t really any good games out for it yet anyway it takes about a year or so for something decent to come out so I will wait.Thank you for making the price is way too high so I’m not even attempted to purchase one of these"
1410,Nick M.,2020,1,Absolutely a complete rip off!!
1411,E.S.,2020,1,Seems dishonest
1412,Neal B,2020,1,3x....pls don't fall for these scams.
1413,Miguel,2022,1,Just get a PlayStation. You’ll have nothing but troubles with it like I have. It’s not even a true 4k 120hz.
1414,Azure House,2021,3,"‘Quick Resume’ does not reliably work, and games like Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla make you CHOOSE between higher quality or 60FPS.I have not seen a significant difference in graphics quality between the One X and the Series X.  If I were to recommend a consult to someone at this point, I would say save your money and just buy the XBOX One X.The one saving grace of this console that I HAVE noticed is slightly faster load times for games.  That’s about it.EDIT:Less than one week in, and I now seem to be getting black and pink “artifacts“ on the screen.  I have reached out to GameStop for a return/exchange."
1415,leah erickson,2020,3,"The difference in game quality both graphically and responsiveness was night and day from my Xbox One. The console powers on and delivers me to the hone screen in less than 2 seconds, and boots games in a similar timeframe.One major issue Microsoft needs to address, but probably won't, is the fact that many gaming monitors aren't compatible with the xbox at 1440p 120hz. These monitors can run these specs over hdmi 2.0, but don't conform to the standard VESA timings, which is all Microsoft uses. This limits many high end gaming monitors to 1080p 120hz, or 1440p 60hz, which is unfortunate. If you plan to upgrade your tv or monitor, make sure you do considerable research into which model will actually work like it should with the Series X."
1416,tigmaster,2020,1,"These people are the lowest of low,just praying on people the worst of humanity."
1417,mike smith,2021,3,"when i click see all buying options it is blank, ive tried everything...this has been happening for over 2 days."
1418,Gabriel,2020,1,A Xbox series x cost $499 not this crazy price.
1419,Dan ,2021,1,These people are absolute scum for buying these up and selling at a ridiculous price I was luck and got one one and I absolute love it but if you have a xbox one S or X stay with it until the xbox series x is available in high quantities DONT GIVE YOUR MONEY TO SCUM BAGS WHO ARE SCALPING PEOPLE let them all lose there investments until they sell for 500$ flat I would use very strong words if I could but I don't want this review and one agian to the people selling these you are scum for ripping people off
1420,dwayne,2022,1,"Got the invite to buy, got several errors and then I wasn't invited. Now the invite is expired."
1421,Amazon Customer,2022,1,My xbox series x came with a broken disc drive.  This is infuriating since my Xbox one came with a broken disc drive as well.  Microsoft needs to fix their issues.
1422,J. D. Cooper,2021,1,"If for no other reason to see these Friggin scalpers get stuck with all these units they have to sell at a loss!But from my family members experience,1.  you will loose the ability to stream to PC or Mac.2. I know the console OS was a little buggy at release, but that seems to be cleared up now.3. due to the new geometry it may be a challenge to find a place to put it where it will physically fit.4. that brings me to the next issue cooling, the console itself has prottey good cooling like most console but unless you are willing to make this a new piece to livingroom furniture do some planning on this. Remember it's al bright and ""shiny' now that it's new. but this time next year, you'll just be looking for a place to get it out of the way.I'm not whining. I am an original owner back to 2001, and i will probably buy one if Microsoft ever stops letting the dealers sell to these poachers, word of advice, look to Target, they have the best practice for selling these fairly so far."
1423,Nick W,2021,1,"I'd like to start off by saying that the first few weeks I had the xbox series x it was a great console. Fast load times and solid frame rates have made for a pleasant gaming experience. Game-pass ultimate is also an excellent value. That said I'm not a happy customer. yesterday I fired up my console to start playing some Star Wars Squadrons. There I am, skimming the deck of a star destroyer in my x wing and the xbox shuts down. ""That was strange"" I say to myself. So I played some Destiny 2. There I am in the new seasonal event. My group kills this boss and I'm about to get my loot. The Xbox shuts down. Finally the next day I try to play some Gears 5. I'm enjoying myself, shooting up locust and sawing monsters in half....and it shuts down.  After hours of troubleshooting and testing, I finally give in and call Microsoft support.I don't have a $500 gaming console. I have a $500 paperweight that's getting sent in for repairs. It took me a month of trying to buy a Series X to secure one. Now I need to wait a month until I get my console back in working order. After my experience with the Xbox 360, I'm not at all confident that Microsoft will get it right.  If I get my console back and it works as it's supposed to, I'll change my review. If not it stays at 1 star.The TLDR is this. Buy a gaming PC if you can, the headache Xbox consoles will give you just isn't worth it...P.S. I purchased my console directly from Microsoft"
1424,Rayvin R.,2021,2,"Okay ive been team xbox almost my whole life and i saw this console and was like oooo with all these fancy features and fast ssd. BUT PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WAIT! i regret purchasing this thing so damn soon. the thing that i realized very fast is that none of these features work for external hard drives like 0. and like what there is maybe...20 games that are good that you would want to play well guess what. thats the whole hard drive filled. oh but they got this sweet expansion card, oh wait.... its $200 for 1 TB you see where this is all starting to go down hill right? even EVEN if they made a like...i dunno a expansion card dock or something. THAT WOULD COST LIKE MAYBE DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE AMOUNT YOU SPENT ON THE CONSOLE. so please for all my xbox gamers that have a ample amount of games on their downloads looking to switch over to the series x, DONT please wait for prices to go down, or for them to make new expansion cards. your gonna be stock with a glorified xbox one x at MOST and on very rare occasions a series x for 2 or 3 games. im sorry microsoft but you REALLY need to do something about this."
1425,Gregory G.,2021,1,"Never heard of not seeing a console on store shevels for a whole year after launch anywhere. Microsoft can only repeat the same nonsense about supply and demand with no definitive answer as to when it will be readily available. Since official launch November 2020 they've dribbled out a handful of consoles every month that sellout before you can even refresh a webpage and stores won't even both ordering so few of them. Then of course there is EA who expects you to pay a subscription of more money for crap services on top of an expensive console for a slim chance of getting one sooner. If they couldn't keep up anywhere near demand than they shouldn't have released it in the first place, this is a despicable business tactic by Microsoft who's now fully in bed with even a more despicable company like Electronic Arts. As of right now you have no hope of getting a console anytime soon unless you want to pay triple of what it costs. You'd have better luck building an Xbox from Stone knives and bear skins yourself."
1426,JOYCE S,2021,2,"I was very excited to get the series x as a Christmas gift but less than 30 days old and my unit wouldn't turn on. Contacted support and finally was advised to send it in for repair. If you don't pay Microsoft an extra $10 for fast shipping you wait another 2 weeks for your unit to come back to you. After all that time the new unit will not switch out of power saving mode. Spent 3 hours on the phone with tech support only to end up having to send it back again. Complained I should be given free fast shipping support agent agreed and had to contact another department to make this happen. Can't get any label fast or slow at this point because I requested the fast shipping, it has been a week. Called support back got no where. The support people are nice but English is their second language so communication has been an issue. This unit costs $500 and does not work correctly, service is lacking. Wait till the problems have been worked out with this unit before you buy!!"
1427,BillH,2020,1,"Look bottom line is if you already have an Xbox One X,,,wait. Save your money keep it in your pocket use that money to buy games that you can still play on X1X.. right now you're not going to get any better graphics the best you might get is some frame rates and some load times. If that's really worth another $500 or more plus all the hassle of stock to you then I feel kind of sorry for you. You can get better load Times sligjtly better Graphics an proformance by just buying a Samsung T5 or an good SSD on X1X an PS4 Pro.. That's what I do. By the time games are actually FULLY next-gen mid gen console that's more powerful come out.. day one edition consoles are for the Beta testers. Then the Alphas come in and get the better deals the better product with the better content.. same with the PlayStation. Since I only use PlayStation for exclusives there's no reason for me to get one for at least a year... DONT BUY FROM THESE SCALPERS.. LET THEM SPEND THERE MONEY AN GET NOTHING OR JUST THE BETA TESTERS MONEY"
1428,mary seaton,2020,3,I’m a fan of Xbox but not impressed they took out the Kinect factor so I can’t monitor what is being said while my grandson is playing also storage cost is unreal this little box can turn into a money pit if not careful love my old Xbox x
1429,AmazonReview,2021,1,"Bought it once resellers dropped to $450. Really really wish I didn’t. I have the Xbox one S that everyone trashes on so much once they get the new system. Let me just say that you tech people love sniffing your own farts out of a snifter or something. There is a difference yes. But you make it sound like Assassins creed can not even be played on an Xbox one S. Maybe it doesn’t look as great, but this new one sure as hell doesn’t make me scream “IM SO GLAD I PAID $450 FOR ASSASSINS CREED TO LOOK LIKE THIS!!!!!!” Its a decent luxury that I’ve given to my daughter so she can see her Minecraft cubes a little bit better. Wait until games come out, Microsoft releases more systems for a realistic price (comparable to the ps5 digital, not $150 more) and you’ll be juuuuuust fine. Screw the resellers."
1430,Zack Campbell,2021,1,"Having both a PS5 and an Xbox Series X -- I can safely say the PS5 is the real next-gen experience.Both have great base hardware, but the PS5 makes a real leap into the next generation with the groundbreaking DualSense controller, amazing 3D Audio, and a whole new UI -- While Xbox Series X is just a hardware boost to the pre-existing Xbox One. What a disappointment.And that's to say nothing of the massive games deficit between the two, which will only keep growing -- Sony has many of the world's finest studios churning out unparalleled experiences.I just can't find a reason to turn on my Xbox Series X at all right now. I imagine I'll find some reason eventually, but I have a strong feeling it's never going to justify the $500 price tag -- nor even a $300 one.I know the PS5 is hard to find right now, but keep trying. It's worth it."
1431,Reaxions,2021,1,"Amazon took a few months to send me an invitation to buy this, so I ended up buying it through Microsoft.Where do I start? It never works correctly. I have to restart it EVERY SINGLE TIME to go online, even though it's hardwired. When I restart it, it connects EVERY SINGLE TIME. Huh?The controller range is NO BETTER, so I can't put it into my dedicated media closet with its own sealed HVAC system to keep it cool and virtually eliminate dust.Additionally, even though this Series X is being played on the absolute latest and greatest home theater and professional audio equipment (trust me on this one), I can't tell a difference between it and my One X.Lastly, I had to buy the stupid 2TB SeaGate hard drive, even though I already had the previous 9 TB Seagate HD. Still, I couldn't tell a difference in load times, etc.All in, I'm at almost $1,000 for the ""privilege"" of owning Microsoft's newest junk, but it's actually worse than the previous One X in SO MANY WAYS. I've been an Xbox fanboy since the original (I'm old), but this one misses the mark severely. I REALLY wish I hadn't wasted my money on it"
1432,A. Monkey,2020,2,"I was really looking forward to the series X, and was excited when I managed to get one in a Wal-Mart drop.  So far it has been nothing but frustration.  There is no optical port, which is bad since my receiver doesn't take HDMI.  The worst part is it won't connect wired.  My Xbox One and TV are the only things in my house I don't do wireless, and I would strongly prefer the series X be wired as well.  Support has been absolutely no help whatsoever."
1433,Pilchard,2021,1,"So far it's been over half a year, and this console is never in stock anywhere. The only interaction I have with it is seeing images or reviews of it online. Amazing that it is never in stock but always listed as an item to purchase at almost all online stores. This is the bot vs retailor vs consumer game the goal should be to hit MSRP, so far it looks like consumers are losing. That is the only game to play for now, maybe for the next few years. In the meantime, my old PC will have to do. Which oddly has upgrade issues of it's own not entirely dissimilar to those of the Xbox."
1434,Baudy Rodriguez,2022,1,IT's Awful
1435,Andrew S.,2021,1,"No way in hell this console is worth over $500... I'm not even sure its worth that much lol. As of now, there is literally no reason to own this console over a Xbox One except the faster load times. No new exclusive games, same exact services the Xbox One provides, etc. I can wait till 2030 when the next console is announced and these actually start becoming available... and even then I might just skip it lol. I have more fun with my GameCube anyways XD"
1436,michael baldini,2021,1,"Microsoft is updating their old games so they are no longer able to be saved on your old external hard drive’s, forcing you to buy a hard drive that costs over $200 if you want to continue playing your old games that you enjoyed on the old Gens.  They are figuring out more ways to charge us more money for what we’ve already paid for. I’m considering switching over to PlayStation or PC at this point. seriously look it up , The new dead by daylight update is an example of making the game no longer work with the seagate hard drives"
1437,Josh Dub,2022,1,It came broken and ps5 would be better then this any day way overpriced
1438,ANIMACHARGE,2022,1,"this is genuinely sad, i can't even buy a new gen console for the actual price"
1439,Shannon Young,2021,1,"To start, I have been playing video games since 1984. I have found amazing games I have loved on about every generation of console. With that said, I got a series x a week after they were released.  I was extremely excited to try out the new features and play ""next gen"" games. The console has been nothing but a disappointment. There are no good games and I feel like the release of this console has ruined gaming for me. I log in every single day and then just turn the console back off. There is nothing to play."
1440,Matthew A. Moore,2022,2,Don't think you can just play split screen w friends.  20-30 minutes to get accounts logged in EVERY TIME.  INEXPLICABLY INFURRIATING!!  The opposite of fun.
1441,Veronica T.,2021,1,The Xbox Series X is being sold above the asking price of $499.99 from its creators. They should be banned from selling the game systems at anything above $550. It's not right and fair to the ones that want one but can't get one because of the greedy that goes and buy them all.
1442,Danny,2022,1,"Don't buy this for watching movies on Blu-ray. There's terrible audio delay when watching movies, literally no possible way to fix it."
1443,Shannon Thompson,2020,3,"Haven’t got one because of scalpers but I know it’s great, it would be great if companies like this one would actually do something about them.Great console, horrible distribution and execution."
1444,Mumenrider12,2021,1,"It didn’t make me any better at video game to spend the extra money now, and buy one of these ridiculously priced XBOX Series X’s when I could have just waited anyways, and let the people with money figure out the bugs themselves.Anyways, it didn’t slice my bologna or cream cheese my bagel. I asked it to clean up the living room and it didn’t do that either. Would not buy from this customer."
1445,Amazon Customer,2021,1,"A man works hard to get by and make a living, looking forward to a little leisure time at the end of the day. And this is what we get? This is 6 months worth of groceries. I have to choose between eating ramen noodles and saltines and playing xbox. Or eating steak and salad and staring at the wall for 6 months? I thought I lived in America. I work 60 hours a week, and it's still not enough apparently. Maybe I should move to China. I hear over there you can eat tuna steaks AND play a god damn game of Halo."
1446,Emmett Shatley,2021,1,"Selling a 499 dollar machine for twice as much, or more, is ridiculous and scummy. I wanted so badly to get one for my wife, who’s favorite game is Halo, but it doesn’t look like that is ever going to happen."
1447,PAMtMan,2021,1,Heard this console is awesome. The problem is that scalpers are using a Amazon’s platform to exploit the membership. How long until Amazon makes the necessary changes by creating a price gouging policy to protect its customers from Great Products like the Xbox & PlayStation etc. being exploited by scalpers.
1448,April Baxter-Bennett,2021,1,This is getting old. Selling out in 20 seconds is straight stupid. Trying to buy on and Amazon asks you to verify your card that IS DIGITAL AND PROGRAMMED INTO AMAZON DOESN'T WORK. Then by the time you switch cards itsgone. I bet all the boys had no trouble getting them AMAZON YOU SUCK YOU KNOW WHAT.
1449,Daniel S.,2021,1,"Console is just a face lifted Xbox, doesn't bring anything cool to the party. This listing has opened a lot of people's eyes up to the scalpers. Now I'm checking other item listings to see this isn't where it began even. Scalping is all over Amazon. Won't be using Amazon for any more purchases. Hope this service rots in heck."
1450,Amy Mendez,2021,1,"I hope all those who are bulk buying to price gauge will end up eating the cost. It is disgusting that this is allowed. Shameful, really!"
1451,Amazon Customer,2022,1,Yea this is horrible. Can’t believe your doing this to the people that have been playing your guys console and just feeding you money for yeeeeeears.  You guys are really disappointing.
1452,Itsmeagain,2021,1,"I managed to get my hands on a system only to find out that every time I load any game (i tried multiple ones, even less demanding downloads) the system crashes and turns itself off. 1 day and many many hours of troubleshooting and the brand new system has to be sent to microsoft for repairs before its ever enjoyed.Microsofts forum on the issues shows this to be a fairly common problem with people having to get it fixed multiple times even."

1456,wister vivas,2020,1,People should not buy to this kind of speculators. Those people are the reason why we can’t find consoles at a regular price.!
1457,Lorenzo Arenas,2022,1,Over a year later... Out of stock and still overpriced.  Your advertisements look so good though!
1458,s,2022,5,"2022 summer update owned for 6 months.Should i really need to write this review? I hope not> i'm not going to write pros and cons. I'm just going to give you data. You decide.what is in this black box you see:- blueray player- 3700 cpu- 6700xt gpu- god tier optimizations- controller- zero sound- fantastic warranty- GAMES ARE CHEAP. You buy used. disk. Cyberpunk 7, witcher 10, RD2 18 just examples.- no heat.- you can buy 3 year warranty from msft for 30 bucks- gam pass is cheap and good.- premium psu500.I've had this for 6 months now. if you are still watiing for a gpu please give this a try let the gpus come back down they aren't worth it yet. I have a 1080ti and this thing. This looks better and plays faster than that. Your going to need even in summer 2022 about 600 for a gpu  to have any hope of competing with this in any significant way, and even then. i'd argue almost 3070/3080I tried the 3080 ventus 12gb. It was loud hot, and the games frankly didn't really look much better. It was maybe 5 percent on cyberpunk. You could barely tell it was like a little more smoke, some light flashing. I returned it and stuck with this. It wasn't worth 800 for the gpu. I'll wait there for prices to get 6 or under. Unless your totally against xbox or consoles this is the way to go. Even the control it's so good they kept it backwards compatible iwth a replaceable batter.THIS IS THE BEST TECH PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE. Sony and Microsoft kept gaming accessible. yes suppy was hard for a while. hats off to them for being responsible though. buy this and have a great time. I did.original review------------------I had ancient consoles. The original Ps4/xbox one (got xbox one free from a garbage it was broken with a bad drive), and xbox 360. Going to be honest traditionally a pc gamer. but zero value.Main con. I wanted to start here because this is mainly a positive review. But i really don't think you deserve to have your hard earned money go to scalpers. Just wait. IMO neither of the main consoles are entirely worth all the freaking out at this point. yes they are better (mainly load time) and if you have 4k and want higher refresh you benefit there too, but neither have a ton of games that really are that next level. I noticed loading time differences, but to my eyes that's the main thing w/o more game support. Many developers aren't going to write games for these yet yeah because well they are hard to get. You can also wait and get improvements and minor tweaks they make as they discover issues in both. that takes 1-2 year often times or more.Update -- more games supported now --- still no sanity in gpu market. I feel this or ps5 is by far your best bet if you care about value.Other con  (specific to xbox) less exclusives. that said in my ps4 experience i never really enjoyed any of them. I play Witcher 3/2, cyberpunk, divinity, read dead redemption, skyrim cog (a very little) and games like that. So this was all academic to me. Xbox had more of what i wanted interms of specs, how it's built, and raw power, online presence. I personally think this time around it's the better console. I also prefer the backward compat controllers with replaceable batteries. i also go a 3 year warranty.This console fell into my lap so i got it. I paid 400 new, and bought the extra 3 year warranty for 30 dollars from MSFT (their complete plan like apple care). I recommend you not spend more than 500, buy from a good retailer like amazon or msft store, and then consider the warranty.  Guess where i work. I got it for a discount new from the msft store :) I also want to be upfront about that. But i like the product, and i wanted to share these thoughts. I only paid for the ps4 last gen.Pros- looks to me better than the ps5. I love that you can place it reasonably vertical or horizontal (i still prefer horizontal due to reduced tipping chances)- same controllers with replaceable batteries. this was and continues to be my preference.- most power vs competition /long term-- mainly academic now. I know the loading  time gets press in psf, but the raw power of the series x will win out over time as games actually are written to take advantage of it. it's a better GPU and CPU, and this is exactly why i bought the ps4 last time it intern was cheaper and better than the original xbox one.- can be had at a reasonable cost esp vs video cards if you need a new device- will last for many years at this point in the cycle.- i personally like that it handles vertical and horizontal particularly well.- great loading times- repairability. In the previous version ps4 was better, now it's tilted to xbox again here too. the internal ssd can be replaced (the built in one). not the case with ps5. They soldered that. It's not academic it's how i fixed a broken xbox before.  Cooling is good on both. I think it's safe to assume you'll be able to use ps5 for xbox series x for 10 years, i mean i'm still using my 360, so i plan to here as well.-value : frankly if you just pay msrp the consoles are of particular value. PC gaming is too volatile and expensive. you are early in the generation. i should have bought my ps4 earlier, but for that i paid 150 on a target sale when they were dumping some originals, but for this in exchange i waited 70% into the generation on my 360. I say if you can get one of these a little earlier first 1/3 of the generation it makes more sense.- storage expand: The cartages are more expensive on extensive storage, but you can already get cheap replacements /adapters with nvme on Chinese sites. In addition, it's not much more costly than say a samsung pro etc which is required for PS5 anyway.  When you want you can simply just swap in new drives to your hearts content. it's not that bad a of a system to be completely honest. 360 had something like this.- you can get the extended warranty for 3 years from Microsoft (Microsoft complete for 30 dollars). I think that is well worth it. there are a lot of parts and things that can go wrong.- i like the online service for xbox better than sony and the backward compat library eg wticher 2- i like the mod story better on xbox, for games. they are simply less restrictive. though sony has lighted up on that.- boot times is fast.- zero crashes or bugs so far.Some attributes and their thoughts.Multi player/online: vs pc i don't like the multi player experience for either console (it's expensive if you have kids and you want to play with them) however i'm pretty much done with pc gaming with these gpu prices, volatility and all the dramma there. Think about it it's been going on now for many years. If someone had told me people would be destroying the environment for mining fake money 15 years ago i'd not have believed them. if i ever hear the term mining again it will be too soon. For now we are fairly insulated from that crap so i'm getting off that ship, get on this  gen early and just ignoring pc gaming.value: You can't go wrong with either playstation or xbox at retail price. For me xbox was available and the power and repairability and the online gameplass stuff put it well in favor for me this time. i'm not really aligned with either like i say i was more aligned to ps4 last time for much of the same reasons. It was more powerful and i wasn't purchasing a kinect i didn't need.os: After using this device i appreciated several things about xbox beyond the clear performance and quality. Most of the internals are premium. The operating system is less bugging. Apps just close when you are trying to exit a game and get to streaming services, though i find the interface in sony a bit more intuitive, i don't find this one hard to use, and of course that personal. Xbox does seem to actually work better though. Many times in ps4 id be playing red dead or some game like this and have to attempt to open prime vieo like 10 times. It's been an issue for years, unless you manually kill the previous app.sound: Another nice thing about the series x is how quiet it is. They use one massive fan that hardly needs to spin to cool the device.Backwards compat:  The controllers feel great to me before and they still do. Though i like the playstation controllers to be honest as well. As i said having battery packs that are easily changeable is awesome on xbox. Everything is backwards so you can use old ones. I've not felt like i've missed  by staying the course there.Repairability:Power supply: i wish it was still external. That's usually the failure point of either of these devices. not always but usually. you can buy them online, but it was nice to buy new psus for the xbox 360 /one in the original after 10 years or so when they fail.Drives: the drivers can fail and require desoldering a board. It continues to be annoyingAll the storage can be replaced. Trust me i've had to do this as i said. Everything fails with time. not soldering everything to a mother board is just good sense.It's about 100 and something but i recall you can get most things on these xboxes repaired from msft. That's also nice.cleaning: i don't love the cleaning story. it's really hard to get to any of the heat sinks. I 've got 2 dogs, and a gsd. it'll be interesting as the years go on what the cleaning experience is like."

1475,Doc,2021,1,Bought from Target day 1. The console has connection issues from Xbox hardware connections. My controller is constantly disconnecting from the console and when it does this the only way to repair is to hard reset. There is no other solution.

I was a little wary of paying this much (close to $900) and doing so from a third-party, but I just really wanted to experience the next generation of gaming.Everything seemed to be alright when I opened the box. I followed all instructions to set up my XBox and soon enough I was ready to play. I began playing an online game and a couple of minutes into the match my XBox began lagging. Then, my XBox started making a loud rattling type noise and abruptly shut all the way off (perhaps to protect itself?). The controller light was left blinking and not responding. I had a terrible, sick feeling, but I decided to try again. Maybe my internet connection was bad or something? Soon after restarting the system, I began playing again. I checked the connection first and had full signal strength, so it couldn’t be that. I started the same game over again and the same exact thing happened again. I tried a game on a disc next and the same problem occurred. Desperate to play some games, I put up with this nonsense for a couple of days. There were some times where I got in some solid gaming, but the system would always eventually lag, rattle, and shut off. Finally, I reached my mental limit and decided to call XBox. I sent my Series X in to be repaired because thankfully it was still under warranty.I am not going to get on here and berate anyone. I am just extremely disappointed in the whole situation occurring in gaming today: scarcity of consoles, outrageous pricing, etc.My goal I’m writing this is to hopefully make others think twice before giving in and paying way too much for a potentially faulty product.If I could go back and do it over again, I would not make this purchase. I would wait patiently to find a console in the stores for retail price. I cannot help but feel cheated."
1584,Billy Gaston,2022,5,"I've been PC gamer the bulk of my life, but with graphic cards being insanely priced the last few years, I've decided to go the less expensive route and upgrade my Xbox 360 (which still works perfectly, never had an issue).  Granted, I'm not saying this thing is great because my last system is approaching 15 years old.  This thing is great because of all the small things it allows.  Switching between games is super quick (excluding physical disc changing, that is subjective), loading up Prime Video or HBOMax is seemingly faster than my PC, and you can organize your screens (add/remove stuff, change priorities)The controller is familiar, feels less heavy, and super comfortable.So far the only negative experience is one game I'd been looking forward to playing doesn't work.  Few years back I saw there was a game that allowed you to use He-Man as your avatar, small, lesser known game called Toy Soldiers: War chest edition.  As I understand the game has had issue almost since launch, so not blaming the Series X, I was just hopeful.Anyway, game run smoothly, the fast switching feature is super cool, and if you can afford it Game Pass Ultimate will keep you loaded with more games than you can finish in that month.If you are like me and occasionally playing on older console, it's time my friend, just do it."
1585,Discount Lots,2022,5,"I have had the Xbox series S for about year now.  When these FINALLY in stock and at normal retail price (I refuse to pay a penny more) I picked one up.  Many people say you don't need the ""X"" if you have the ""S"".  This is true if you don't have a 4k TV.  If your running 1080p - 1440p - keep the Series S.  Using this on a 4k TV is night a day. The sound seems to be much richer as well.  IF you can get it at normal retail price (499.99) - buy it.  Dont spend a PENNY more!This is far and away the best bang for your buck when It comes to gaming.  Try to put together a PC with these stats.  The video card alone will cost more than the Xbox Series X.PS5 looks like a child's toy compared to this beast."
1586,Quincy C.,2022,5,"I FINALLY was able to get my hands on a Series X to replace my Xbox One.  What an upgrade!  Load speeds are so much faster than my Xbox One and games run smoothly with crisp images.  The Series X is a monster though.  It outsizes the Xbox One by a good amount, so make sure you have room for it (see pic).  It also runs hot, so give it good ventilation."
1587,Amazon Customer,2022,2,"The console itself looked to be in great shape. Then I turned it on, the previous owners profile still logged in games still on it (again not a big deal) after a few minutes of it being on the console shut itself off. I updated the console hoping that would remedy the issue and still shuts off after a few minutes.After about the 4th or 5th time of turning the console back on it stayed on for around 20 minutes and then went back to shutting off. Fan was running, and the console didn’t seem to be too hot.It went on to shut off around 8 more times within an hour span. So needless to say within an hour of opening it I packed it back up."
1588,Brandon Springer,2022,5,"Stand at six inches wide, six inches long, and approximately one foot tall, this console is quite large. At least larger than anticipated. I feel that it processes much faster than the Xbox one. It’s really easy to set up. They got rid of the power block and went with a simple power cable. It is fairly silent and works amazing. It was a little over priced though, but my Day one Xbox one was slowing down quite a bit snd the upgrade was necessary."
1589,Heggel González,2022,5,"I was a little worried due to the negative comments, but probably they were only for the firsts batches. Mine work just perfect. In games that you can play on the XBOX ONE, you will notice the big difference on playing in native 4k. Also it is way faster in loading games and maps. It improves the overall experience, and again, it feels faster in everything.No heating, no sound at all. A little bit expensive, but I think it worth it"
1590,AFWxman,2022,5,"I admit I got really lucky and happen to check the stock... was able to snag one! I normally get my son's old system so naturally he already had an XBSX and I got his XB1X... It was good, but when elden ring came out... I had to upgrade. It's night and day. Fast, responsive, and gorgeous. No issues with setup and transfer of account via the XB app. Overnight Prime delivery too... Can beat it!"
1591,Random Reviews,2022,5,"The Xbox x series is by far the best Xbox! For the price it isn’t bad! Way better then PlayStation for sure. The graphics, how fast it runs, just the overall performance of this Xbox is beyond perfect! I’m so happy I finally got this Xbox! If your looking to purchase but not sure if you should. Then this is it, BUY THIS XBOX! You will not go wrong or be unhappy with your purchase!"
1592,Omar Rodríguez,2022,5,"This thing is incredibly powerful! You can say goodbye to those annoying loading screens in most games, it's truly blazingly fast!Games look stunningly sharp and beautiful in 4k. Although I don't have a 120fps TV, 60fps is good enough in my opinion.All in all, I'm very pleased!"
1593,LoriAnn,2022,5,Finally was able to get a series x on the prime member restock and not have to pay above normal price!! This console is a workhorse! Games load & install so much faster! network transfer makes the transfer from the old unit to the new quick and easy! Plays all generation Xbox discs!!
1594,TheD,2022,5,"If you are a casual gamer who likes to hop on from game to game for casual fun, this is the console to get and Game Pass.If you like to buy the games, then PS5 exclusive games are worth paying for.Xbox is like Netflix, sit on the couch and stream what you want when you want.PS5 is like that movie you want to watch in a theatre.Both are different, it depends on how you play your game."
1595,dan lilly,2021,5,"Thank you Amazon and Amazon Seller, you have won me over and I appreciate this purchaseTarget pulled a ut-oh, this happens all the time when I arrived to pickup my internet paid for purchaseManager even went on to say no one ever complained about it before, that I was the only one.Left before further escalation, but just WOW. I will not be repeating that (there) ever again"
1596,Kera Moseley,2021,5,My son just received this and is truly amazed at how fast it is and the design. It out performs the specs on it. He is thrilled with how fast it is and it's cooling system.  I know this is the newest version but he says it is night and day compared the previous model. And he doesn't mind the sleek mini refrigerator look. He actually really like it.
1597,Crib Notes,2022,5,"I was fortunate to get one about $150 over list. Fast shipping on their part, but they use fedex and I don’t ever have good luck / experience with them. Box was dented pretty good on a corner, but Xbox is packed very well and no problem."
1598,Cole teichgraeber,2021,5,This was a huge upgrade from my regular Xbox one! 120 fps is unreal. The boot speed is also amazing I used to have to wait a while for it to boot up and now its almost instant! I definitely recommend the upgrade over the original Xbox one. Just glad I was able to get my hands on it.
1599,Rosalyn Stokes,2021,5,"Ordering was super easy, the Xbox came exactly when it was promised and it was in perfect, brand new condition. We're very pleased."
1600,Nicholas De La Rosa,2022,4,"Got both consoles luckily, and after playing both Xbox has the better edge in my opinion, only complaint is the PS exclusive games I wanna play lol"
1601,Verl,2022,5,New to gaming. This was everything I was looking for.
1602,Renaissance,2021,5,I'm glad that I bought the xbox for my grandson.  Even though it is a present for xmas he plays already and has lots of fun.  He loves it!  He can play all his old games on it too.
1603,Brad,2022,5,"I was a skeptic, this was something i couldnt find anywhere else and usually much higher priced than what i had seen here.  Have to say there was no problems at all and it even arrived earlier than expected"
1604,Brittany Mullins,2022,5,Works amazing. Seller sent me a link to track my package. They were very helpful
1605,King Nii,2021,5,Was able to win a tough raffle to win theis xbox for my lil sis. Arrived in timely manner and extremely happy about it.
1606,Michael T.,2021,5,"My son bought this for himself,  everyone wanted over 1000.00 dollars for it, well under 800.00, perfect product at a great price"
1607,Lois D.,2022,5,Gaming console at its finest!
1608,Eduardo Barajas,2022,5,It came in perfect condition as promised. Definitely a trusted seller. (xbox series X)
1609,José Luis Romero,2022,5,sin lugar a duda excelente inversion para toda la familia
1610,Amazon Customer,2022,5,awesomr
1611,James G,2022,5,Delivered safely and secure. System performs as expected and Xbox pass allows me to play tons of games for a low subscription fee.
1612,Kindle Customer,2021,5,Everything! Load times are non existent
1613,Zachary Mitchell,2022,5,Absolutely incredible console. Has an extra 300gb of stock internal storage than my PS5 and also offers VRR (variable refresh rate) which my PS5 does not. Playing on Samsung QN90A.
1614,Robert White,2021,5,"Runs amazingly, did not buy from scalper I got mine on prime day and it was worth the wait. Amazingly fast load up time, very quiet, I love it"
1615,Edin Selimovic,2021,5,"5 star Review , best Next gen console due to its speeds , game pass , and next gen games.Highly recommended ."
1616,Bribrew1968,2022,5,Love it. App integration rocks!
1617,Gamerism1,2022,5,good product and seller 👍
1618,Annamarie C.,2021,5,Its awesome to be able to play in Dolby vision at 4k/120hz!!! Forza is awesome! I was lucky to get this so I hope it is more available soon :)
1619,John sullivan,2021,5,The best Xbox I love it
1620,VicYay,2021,4,"I believe everyone is happy with the Xbox Series X restock. The console is amazing but the package could be better because it was placed in a huge box with some tissues around. No foam protectors and the outside box has been broken upon delivery. Thanks god the Xbox was fine. But again, I appreciate the restock. Hope to see more in the future."
1621,Rodney Wolfe,2022,5,This was an early Christmas present to myself.  So much better than I expected.  Very fun am going to take some getting used too.
1622,edward eric roberts,2020,1,999$? You’ve got to be kidding. No one is going to pay 500 more than retail value.
1623,Christian Medina,2021,5,"Muy bueno, llegó exelente muchas gracias. Una velocidad de carga de juegos fabulosa. La mejor consola"
1624,Franklin Marvin Aquino,2021,1,I love the console & next generation features  but very disappointed about the price.
1625,B. Isherwood,2021,5,"Supports select Xbox, Xbox 360, and all Xbox One games in addition to the new Xbox Series X titles.This is also the best console platform to consume GamePass (IMHO, the best deal in gaming today)."
1626,Emizzzy453,2022,5,The best console by far .. gamepass easily disrupts the gaming competition. And the console is quick not to mention it has quick resume as well and smart delivery meaning you don’t have to buy the game again from another console .. Xbox is extravagant! Boom
1627,Mauro Goñi,2022,5,Exelente envio
1628,Erik Torrez,2022,5,I was a little skeptical at first but so far so good been 3 months since I got it and I have to say it was well worth the money.
1629,Nancie Sionni,2020,1,Console powered down the first day.  Sending back to xbox
1630,Nancie Sionni,2020,1,Console powered down the first day.  Sending back to xbox
1631,steven shi,2021,5,Great next gen gaming console but still not as good looking as PS5.
1632,rosa,2022,5,"I got this for my 10 year old, he plays with cd games or online purchases. Good quality"
1633,Jay,2021,4,System works great but Box was beat up on delivery. Little embarrassing giving it as a gift
1634,Gabril Botton,2021,5,I can’t wait for it to ship. So excited to play 2k22 on it
1635,michael gambale,2021,5,Worth it so happy I finally got it
1636,Juan Francisco Jácome,2022,5,"Great console, silent and amazing graphics."
1637,Lance m,2022,5,Good Product
1638,Paul Laliberte,2021,5,"I really love the new Xbox Series X. It is exactly what was expected, and amazon was very quick with the shipment speed."
1639,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Fast shipping and all new product.
1640,Alex Bareis,2020,1,no
1641,Frank,2020,4,Heavy unit and big! But not as big as I imagined (pc gamer usually). Runs games smooth and responsive. The UI is much quicker than xbox one.Yakuza game looks beautiful on it. And waiting for cyber punk. The new controller doesn't work with some of my older recharge xbox one battery packs. Luckily. I have rechargeable AAs.Def feels like a nice upgrade from xbox one but if you dont have the money. Don't rush into buying one yet.
1642,Lane L Gibson,2022,5,As a PC gamer this is the first console that has brought something significant to the table!!
1643,Nicole Wright,2020,5,Absolutely amazing product thank you Microsoft!!
1644,Dan Tacker,2021,4,"So when I ordered this I was very skeptical that it was going to be a scam and I wouldn’t get an Xbox or I’d get the original. It arrived yesterday and it’s a better console that the series S. Faster load times graphics are better, the list goes on."
1645,Matt,2021,5,"Powerful compact, system"
1646,Axel Laza,2020,5,Very good to have a product that's hard to find. Enjoyed playing and love the beautiful style of this console.Spiderman game is awesome!
1647,Joshua Chavez,2022,5,this is exactly what I was waiting for. so happy to have my xbox searies x with out any extras for a good price.
1648,Scott Jung,2022,5,I was worried this might be a scam. NOPE it was totally legit. I didn't mind the $150 mark up as its so hard to find these. Its came in a few days all seals were intact.
1649,Gabriel,2020,1,Overpriced
1650,Scott Jung,2022,5,I was worried this might be a scam. NOPE it was totally legit. I didn't mind the $150 mark up as its so hard to find these. Its came in a few days all seals were intact.
1651,Krzysiek,2020,5,Great
1652,R.M.W.,2022,5,Love the graphics and ease of use.
1653,Gabriel,2020,1,Overpriced
1654,WI.Grace,2021,5,I'm a ps5 player but I tried this xbox and I was amazed. Good work xbox team. It comes with 1 controller.
1655,DizzyUnbound,2020,5,"I normally like to wait a bit before giving my review, but I just couldn't wait to mention some things here.This thing is silent. Like.. DEAD silent. My Xbox One X would get sorta loud running BO4 and no doubt would running Cold War, but this thing is very quiet, unless you lean up really close to the top.Contrary to some articles, this thing doesn't really get too hot either. It gets warm, obviously, but it's definitely not as bad as some sources say it is.The d-pad of the controller was a bit of a worry for me when I saw it in photos. But using it just feels so right. The inclusion of a USB-C slot on the controller is also a nice touch. I have mispressed the share button a few times, but when I get a feel for where it is, it's gonna be a game changer.My only gripe so far is that I'm worried something might get into the top part where the fan is and mess everything up. And the power cable felt a tad loose, but nothing worth fretting about too much.All in all, first impressions are really good. If I remember, I'll try to update in a couple months if anything changes. Definitely recommend if you're a fan of Xbox and console gaming as a whole."
1656,Shishka,2020,5,Numbers don't lie better system then PS5 hands down. I know demand higher for PS5 because of todays youth are on the bandwagon. But for the money its a better system. No exclusives but they will have plenty coming i don't care about being spider man there's a reason no exclusives because they are gonna get it right not rush it out.
1657,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"Waiting a long time. Worth the wait, LOVING IT!!!"
1658,Owen,2022,5,I am so happy I got my series x. Its a great console and worth the wait.
1659,Sam M,2020,5,"Powerful, super fast load times, super fast startups, fast app switching, and the system is very quiet. Can’t get much better than that."
1660,Cody Luna,2021,5,Well packaged great shape when it got here and the delivery guy was super friendly and carful with how he handled it! Works like a dream worth every penny spent to finally get some Xbox goodness!
1661,The Shmahz,2022,1,"Don't even want it anymore, gonna just retire from Microsoft consoles I guess. The Xbox one isn't bad either, so there's that."
1662,KenW,2021,5,"Amazon packers, if you are reading this please add more package fillers and mark as fragile. My xBox SX works fine, but the box looked like it had been through combat. One corner was exposed and I wasn't sure if it would even work. So far it works as intended and I've enjoyed every moment of playing my games on this console."
1663,Christopher Hotz,2022,5,Supports UHD 4K 120 fps. Allows CEC and Alexa control. Fast load times. Can be position horizontally or vertically. Very quiet. Most importantly the game pass ultimate cloud gaming is awesome. Using cloud gaming you don’t have to use up the small SSD. Be aware that cloud gaming often times does not support multiplayer.
1664,rod herr,2022,5,Xbox Series X
1665,Ryan ,2021,5,"Got here fast and works good! It is overpriced but if you are tired of trying to get one for the regular price then it’s worth paying a little more to get it and be done with it, overall I’m happy I got one finally, but if you can wait and get one for the normal price I would do that unless you just want to pay a little more and get it"
1666,Misc420,2021,5,Husband LOVES it!
1667,XDIEGenral - Elico,2021,5,Really loving my Series X so far. I'll never regret staying up passed my sleep schedule to pre-order this bad boi. Absolutely love it and I'm proud to be an Xbox Fanboy😁
1668,John effman,2021,5,I like how powerful this xbox is and how good the youtube reviews got about it.
1669,Heidi G. Thomas,2021,5,Love
1670,XDIEGenral - Elico,2021,5,Really loving my Series X so far. I'll never regret staying up passed my sleep schedule to pre-order this bad boi. Absolutely love it and I'm proud to be an Xbox Fanboy😁
1671,John effman,2021,5,I like how powerful this xbox is and how good the youtube reviews got about it.
1672,Justin,2022,3,The controller design is hard to reach certain directional and analog sticks and buttons. But xbox is a good system. Playstation is easier on its controllers.
1673,Luis Flores,2022,5,Great Xbox worth it and was everything that I ever imagined
1674,Orderingthings,2022,5,"Brand new unit, completely factory sealed. Love it!"
1675,Cliff,2022,5,"Best XBOX yet, very fast and works great."
1676,Steve,2021,5,Hands down the best.... my son absolutely loves it. Dad gets his playtime but he loves it. He’s able to navigate through the screens easily and use the controller with no issues. He’s 5 and loves racing games and his paw patrol game. It definitely gets warm but not overheating. Overall It gets an A+ from us.
1677,Anne,2022,5,The box was ripped in the box it was shipped in but other than that the product is amazing !!! Great condition.
1678,Alden D. Thompson,2022,5,I like it a lot. The Xbox series X was really easy to set up and get playing. The resolution is incredible compared to the Xbox one.
1679,Robert Pugmire,2022,5,It is HUGE but is amazing with what it can do
1680,Justin Sobota,2022,5,"It’s sleek and I like the design. Fits well on the desk. Nice form factor. If you are looking for next gen this is worth it but if you have an Xbox One X or Scorpio edition from previous gen, I’d hold out till they come out with a pro or plus model. Another $500 for now would not be worth the performance increase in my opinion."
1681,Robert Pugmire,2022,5,It is HUGE but is amazing with what it can do
1682,Keith Brockwell,2020,5,Everything I expected. I love the quick resume In this  Share button Easy to take screenshots and recordgame play. Best system I have played.
1683,Rogelio,2022,5,everthing about it is good
1684,Bigfoot ,2020,5,It’s a amazing system no problems or technical issues. Pure power and speed makes it worth the upgrade if you have a tv or monitor to take advantage of it.
1685,Tommy,2022,5,I love this console I love the 120 Hz and 1440 P gaming experience. You will need HDMI 2.1 cables and TV for that to work though overall the build quality is amazing and SSD in this consul is extremely fast highly recommend for new buyers in Xboxs
1686,Ryan Smith,2021,5,"I've been trying to score a console for the last few months so i can play halo and finally.. finally! This thing is the real deal, amazing graphics, sick fps, and of course the best xbox exclusives. I get why everyone is trying to get one! the hype is real! best console specs compared to ps5 disc or digital! Recommend!"
1687,Dmitriy,2022,5,"The best console in my opinion. Gamepass gives you incredible opportunities for free play. I like the design (such a small fridge, which is great). Works super fast. I recommend."
1688,fabian,2022,5,amazing Condition
1689,Dj Medic,2020,5,Works like a charm. Everything is so beautiful. Nothing like playing GTA 5 online with no frame rate drop and not waiting for parts of the map to load in. 100% worth especially when I’m coming from the day one Xbox One.
1690,D,2022,5,"First of all, kudos to Amazon for doing this as an invite only.  This is a very good way of getting rid of the resellers and scalpers!  I hope Amazon starts doing this with other high demand items as well.I got this during the October 17, 2022 invite.  In less than 5 days I had this in my hands.  Xbox was shipped in a larger outer box, BUT...........there was no padding or protection!  Luckily, box arrived unscathed.Set-up is like any other Xbox.  This one replaced my old Xbox One.  As soon as I hooked it all up, I downloaded the new Modern Warfare 2 game.  I left the Xbox on overnight and by next morning I was all set to play.  Everything ran as expected!  No problems whatsoever with the set-up and gaming experience.  All-in-all, I am very happy and fortunate to be able to get this, esp. since everyone else is out of stock.  Thank you very much Amazon!!"
1691,Yonah,2022,5,"Works great! Much faster than the Xbox one, the 4K UHD is awesome, the one thing I do not like is that the blue Ray feature is kind of hokey at times, other than that I love it."
1692,Amber Jeska,2021,1,Don’t buy
1693,Jim,2022,5,"My TV is not smart, so I have Roku, Fire, etc hooked up for services. I switched everything over to the Xbox (Disney, Prime, HBO, etc) and it's like I bought a new TV! Picture quality is amazing! And the gaming is better than my ""Gaming"" PC"
1694,Sylvain ,2022,5,"Perfect, microsoft price, perfect delivery"
1695,Bill K,2022,5,Love this new Xbox. The new games are awesome and I can still play my old Xbox 360 games
1696,Jocelyn Penner,2022,5,"Easy to set up, good connectivity to internet, I like being able to set up using my phone."
1697,Melissa H.,2021,5,So glad I was able to get this for my girlfriend for her birthday. She absolutely loves the speed of downloading games and the 4k graphics are out of this world! Best upgrade from the Xbox One!
1698,WHEELZ247 ,2021,5,Very fast delivery and true description of product
1699,Jeremia,2022,5,This is the only gaming system period.
1700,WHEELZ247 ,2021,5,Very fast delivery and true description of product
1701,Lupeq661,2021,4,Very good and reliable console. Only problem is console box was damaged through shipping.
1702,elian,2021,5,"New generation Xbox x everyone want it bro, so lucky get one on amazon with fewer seconds purchase."
1703,Dawson King,2022,5,This xbox series x console works new condition thank you Microsoft and amazon!
1704,Chad,2020,5,The xbox itself is great but the amount of people who are re-selling it for 1000+ dollars makes it very difficult to find a standard product.
1705,Denise Davey,2020,5,"Good console, fast loading, amazing graphics, and awesome features!"
1706,Amber,2021,5,I love my new Xbox and everything about it besides the auto disconnect from my wifi while mid-game... acting as if I have no internet connection. Nothing to do with Amazon- all Microsoft's fault.
1707,Dikembe Blackwell,2020,5,Perfect glad it came so fast
1708,Rafael Hernandez,2021,5,Finally got one and it’s great! Thanks
1709,Danny,2021,1,"What a complete disaster of a disappointment. Yes it's a new console, but you're only getting a $100 upgrade for $500. Sale old interface same old controller. Just a bit faster... definitely Sony has Microsoft by the balls"
1710,5044100614,2021,5,The price is ridiculous but the product is exactly what I wanted
1711,Mr X,2021,5,As awesome as it is made out to be
1712,Country_Hotty,2021,5,"I got my Xbox X Series from a 3rd party Company I did not have no issues with them, And I was post to get my Xbox X Series on the 30th and I got my Xbox X series on the 23rd.. My Xbox x series is super cool I have had no issues with it and I am happy with my xbox..3rd party companies are not bad at all what I did before I ordered my xbox from a 3rd party I looked up the Company to make sure that it is a real company and I looked to see what people said about the company and after everything the company ended up being a good company."
1713,Kenny,2020,5,"Let me tell you the graphics, colors and FPS is greatly noticeable. I came from a PS4 and could not get a PS5. Anyone who writes a review that says it is not a huge jump must be a fanboy for PS or has a high end PC. This console is amazing at playing backwards compatible games and the FPS is highly noticeable. Every game looks stunning in 4k and the colors pop out more than before. If you have an Xbox one you will love this console. If you are like me you may need to buy new games in a different environment. Do not hate on any console, only buy what you want and not the opposite of what is being hated on."
1714,Jpix,2020,5,Tons of PowerGamepassHaloWhat more can a man want?We are living in trying times Xbox will help keep our minds busySolid build and lightening fast UIOri looks gorgeous!
1715,Ricky G,2022,5,"What’s more to say. It’s an Xbox series X. They delivered what they advertised. It works, functions, and preforms as it’s supposed to. It was also severely under resell market value. Highly recommend!"
1716,Dr.P,2020,5,"Very fast loading times, excellent graphics, no software bugs that I can tell, which along with the fantastic value of Gamepass Ultimate is what sets it apart from the PS5 for me. The PS5 crashes sometimes and the new PS5 menu isn't as good as the old one. In contrast, the Xbox menu is unchanged overall and just works well. It's auto-resume feature is fantastic. It is also completely silent. I put decals on mine to give the black brick a little personality."
1717,Andrew padilla,2021,5,A
1718,Eliezer Soto Cavazos,2022,5,Good Product
1719,Brett Wayne Herron,2022,5,"it plays games, and is smarter than the old one."
1720,Claudina,2022,5,My sun love it
1721,Jake,2020,5,"I'm am more than pleased with the new Xbox. Many are saying that the system does not have any games, but I believe it has to many to choose from. I was lucky to get one early but I hope all that truly wants one will get one before the year is out. You will not be disappointed!"
1722,Thuy,2020,1,Console is defective. Turned it on to play for a few hours and it stopped working. Unplugged console for 30 mins and still the same problem.  Going to wait a day to see if there’s any change but this is ridiculous.
1723,Arepo,2021,5,"I'm writing this a couple days late, but want to say thank you! I was on every website trying to buy this for my husband as a surprise. Every website crashed on me, stayed up all hours of the day and night. I gave up.. but then I went to Amazon and it was available!! I could not believe it. I clicked it so fast, ordered it, and it said will be here in one day. Then, next thing you know it is on our doorstep. My husband was so excited and he said it has been working great. He has always had an Xbox, so this was his first switch over and loves it. Great graphics, quick response, overall great buy!The delivery driver was hours early too, which was a plus!Thank you for having it on your website!"
1724,Eric Swendsen,2021,5,Would buy from them again!
1725,Sixto Montoya,2022,5,Bit pricey but it was worth it in the end.
1726,Stephanie,2022,5,I'm very impressed 😏👌
1727,Kevin McCurry,2022,5,This was an upgrade purchase  for me.  4k gaming with the faster speed and extra space is awesome 10/10
1728,Jevgenij Cariov,2021,4,The Xbox was ok but the box came damaged and scratched.
1729,Robert Wagner,2021,5,"Console generations have to act more like PCs. Losing you previous library is no longer acceptable. Much like your iPhone, the gaming console needs to be an evolving experience - offering you new worlds to explore and expanding their capability without losing their prior functionality and compatibility. Xbox Series X absolutely nails it. It may not seem like a massive difference when you first power it up but I defy you not to sing its praises after trying to go back to your Xbox One X. This is the future. 100% satisfied with it and wouldn't trade it for anything."
1730,R. H.,2021,1,Doesn’t even have WiFi 6.Always out of stock to artificially elevate the price. Immoral company.
1731,Jhonny Augustin,2020,5,Loving it! Xbox series X is awesome. I mean if your here to potential buy one then I dought I need to convince you.
1732,Bret,2022,5,The PlayStation is better though
1733,Brian B,2020,5,I was lucky enough to get a pre-order for the series X. Everything was beautifully packaged and it hooked up/worked with no issue out of the box.
1734,Andrew Marchese,2021,5,Fast and efficient.
1735,Donnell,2021,5,Thanks a lot! Order was shipped within a couple hours and it got here a day early!!! Really made my day.
1736,Gary ghazarian,2022,5,Good
1737,Paul,2022,5,"Great, As described A++++"
1738,Kevin,2022,5,Super quiet and super fast. Blows the last gen console out of the water and Amazon is actually selling for the right price not price gouging like most of the internet!
1739,Cassie ,2022,5,Perfect gift for my son
1740,Michelle M,2020,5,I was extremely happy to fulfill my husband's Christmas present wish a little early this year! The seller immediately answered a question I had and shipped it to me before the date I was estimated. My husband has played it every single day since he has gotten it!! Thank you so much for making it quick and easy on me this year!!
1741,Harvey,2021,5,I like having the console. It is definitely an upgrade to the older systems. I don't like how people have been HOARDING them an d getting twice what they are actually worth. When the price came down a little I bought it for my son.
1742,Ismatu Koroma,2020,5,"Fortunate for me I have both the playstation 5 and the xbox, and I can say I prefer the xbox over the playstation. Although both systems are similar, the xbox is faster. Downloads and load time are crazy, and when the controller turns on it turns on quickly as well. The graphics are amazing as well. I cant wait until more games come out so we can see what xbox can really do."
1743,John Conti,2020,5,"Awesome Product, Glad to have gotten it as a preorder from Amazon!"
1744,Kindle Customer,2022,3,"It's not bad but I guess I was expecting more. Like faster dl times. In a side by side test with my xbox one cutscene and game load time where pretty close with the series x. The x being just a little faster. Like maybe a second.The controller is a joke the layout is fine but the response is ludicrous having to jam buttons just to get it to respond unfortunately that is no where good enough for any online play.Not sure if it is just the one I received or this is a known issue. My 1x controller is fantastic with one of the best response times I have ever had.My 1x cost about the same as the series x so it is a small upgrade VERY SMALL.Do I recommend it sure if u have the money and u like xbox why not.But if u have a 1x and are looking to ""upgrade"" I'm not sure this is for u. I despise sony but the ps5 is faster I think it does not seem as if it's quite as bogged down with down load issues.I have a gigabit fiber internet. The fastest I have ever gotten on my 1x is about 230mbps and dl a new game was well a joke. With the series x dl will start at around 500mbps and then I can watch as it counts down to about 120mbps if I run an internet speed test through the series x it says my speed is around 920 to 940 then I can go back to dl screen and see the speed bumps back up around 500mbps only to watch it drop back to about 150mbps or so. This is a known issue with Microsoft xbox and has been for years and years. It's been documented all over the internet just look it up.So again it's not bad if u have the money and in need of an xbox then get it. The graphics are nice but it feels like there are few games actually made for series x just a lot of upgraded one x games.Not sure what happened of the last 5 or 6 years but Microsoft has definitely dropped the ball on that one."
1745,Lorentsen,2022,5,"My favorite console, works beautifully."
1746,Augusto Cabrera,2020,5,"Just as advertised, high speed, great video quality, beware you’ll need a 4K TV to truly enjoy this feature, and if the TV or monitor is 120hz even better.  Easier to setup with the Xbox App, and the overall experience was good.  The controller feels good."
1747,Stephen P,2022,5,Nice gaming console
1748,Tiffany Villagomez,2021,5,"I bought the Xbox Series X for Father's day for my husband.  And he loves it , I was worried when first purchasing it because I saw some people had issues with the product.  When I first recieved the x box Series x I opened it to make sure it was all there and it looked good and it did , which I was happy with. A couple of weeks later my husband opened it for Father's day and was excited to recieve it. We set it up and cut the xbox on , after connecting it to our t.v. , and it worked.  It functioned just fine . I bought it in June and it's now October and it still works perfectly fine,  I have had no issues with it . And it gets played on a daily , at least a few hours each day. I am very happy with this purchase and it was exactly as described."
1749,Jason,2022,5,I’ve played video games before video games were cool. I was a first grade champion when it came to the Oregon Trail on the classroom Commodore 64. Now to this machine…wow! I upgraded from One X and what a difference. I also happened to be lucky enough to have Amazon invite me to purchase. The one star reviews shouldn’t be allowed as they are on the 3P sellers who have the systems marked up. Be patient and you’ll get one. It’s not like Microsoft will launch another console next year…or will they?!
1750,Gail,2021,5,It was for my grandson and he has been playing his games non stop !
1751,Zachery Welsh,2022,5,Finally able to get the new Xbox a few weeks back. Graphics look amazing load times super fast. Lastly enjoy if you get one totally worth if.
1752,trevor,2021,5,very good no long load times easy to maintain
1753,James R Casey,2022,4,"When I am refunded for the return I will change this to 5 stars.  Customer service has been great so far. Luckily I'm not in a rush for the xbox.  It turned on so I assume that's how they tested it.  However, the HDMI port was broken so it wouldn't connect to the tv."
1754,Anthony Morris,2020,5,"So worth the wait, amazing with Game Pass, works as it should with no “bricking” or other concerns so far."
1755,Kenneth P. Krug,2021,5,The order came in with everything it includes and is functioning properly. The only complaint I have is that there was no padding in the shipping box but other than that I'm good. Thank you.
1756,STEVEN,2020,5,Totally awesome. Fastest load times alone are worth the upgrade from an xbox one x.
1757,Ariel,2020,5,"After preordering and getting the email that I would not come until Dec 31st, I panicked and looked for restocks everywhere. I then received a notification the next day that it shipped and low and behold it was here a few days later. No complaints, great system!"
1758,Richie Psywalker,2022,5,Awesome console. it was worth the wait for get it at the retail price.
1759,Jamie,2022,5,Considering the price gouging going on everywhere it was awesome to pay a normal system price again. It's running strong so far!
1760,boggs101,2022,5,Great graphics and lots of fun.  Pricey but all new consoles are.
1761,melissa,2022,5,Had to get on the waiting list. Bought for hubbys birthday. He said the game is so much faster and graphics are clearer.
1762,David,2021,4,Great built quality and overall a good performing console. I don't really like the design though. I feel like it's a bit bulk and it doesn't fit into places I want it to be in.
1763,Witchyways1111,2022,5,"I love my new Xbox. The graphics are killer, the speed in amazing. Worth every penny!"
1764,Cmdr Riker,2022,5,"Even after 2 years, finding the Xbox X at regular price is difficult. Thankfully, Amazon began offering invitations to purchase a single unit at the MSRP of $499. Sign up and receive an invitation when your order can be fulfilled. You have 72 hours after notification to purchase the unit. Then simply order and pay as any other Amazon purchase.The Xbox X has several advantages over the Xbox one. The first thing you notice is the quiet. The loud fans of the past are gone. The large tower look may or may not be your thing. But it runs quiet and smooth. I noticed a better viewing quality on older games. Skyrim looks better than ever on the new console. The gamers out there will love the new Xbox."
1765,Jack Yeslow,2021,5,🤙🤙🤙🤙
1766,Nyfishon,2022,5,Love the upgrade
1767,Gem Rummie,2021,5,Great Xbox. Very reliable seller. It came quickly and packed well.
1768,AP,2021,5,Love this console and all the features it’s packed with right out of the box. Miss the fact it doesn’t have the Kinect camera they had on the last model release Xbox but this console I must say is definitely a beast.
1769,Samuel Gunn,2020,5,I love it
1770,BJ n Mobile,2022,5,Good price and shipped right away
1771,Nolan,2020,1,Overpriced. Don’t pay over $500 for this.
1772,TJ,2020,5,"Shipping and Delivery: My Series X came on launch day as promised. The main box was in a brown padded shipping box. Shout out for that to Amazon. It gives me faith in their shipping process, and with their shipping partner. In my case it was UPS. My personal experience anyways.The Gaming Experience: As for the console, it’s a real monster. It’s like upgrading your PC after 7 years. An instant feeling of power, speed snd graphical output. So yes, you will notice the difference in power, big time, going from the Xbox One to the Series X especially. It’s quick and snappy. The SSD delivers, giving an instant boot up and extremely quick loading times in titles across the generations, whether it’s from 5 years ago or this week. This holds true especially in Series X|S optimized games. I decided to break it in with two games AC: Valhalla and Doom Eternal. It’s as promised. Richer, more dynamic worlds. Fluid frame rates. I couldn’t praise it enough. Ever want to know what a game feels like on a top of the line gaming PC but through the console experience? Series X will deliver on that. I couldn’t be more pleased.The Build: Again, Team Xbox delivered. A solid 14 pounds. So no small console. But it’s top notch in build quality. Heavy, sturdy and striking. I personally believe it’s the finest looking piece of tech in my house. It keeps asking for me to appreciate it as it sits silently in the corner, and each time I turn my head to give it that appreciation. The Series X looks like the premium 500 dollar device it is marked as. Hands down."
1773,Michelle Wright,2020,5,This system is Amazing! It’s super quiet and fast! Lots of storage! Can’t wait to get all my games on this system
1774,Ron O.,2020,5,"Set up was a pain with a Gmail account for my Xbox account..but after that everything is great! 1tb fills up fast though! Forza Horizon 4 looks great, but can't wait to see cyberpunk on this!! The green showing from the top is just colored plastic, not a light (which I was concerned about)"
1775,Mitch,2021,5,$500 is nothing for what this machine is capable of. 100% worth every penny.
1776,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Grandson loves the Xbox. Good product
1777,Robert,2022,5,"Amazing graphics, from going to Xbox X to Xbox series X is Day and night,"
1778,Vargr,2022,5,"I'm not writing a giant review for this product. What you really need to know is I own the S and X, the X is significantly, noticably better in every way except for space conservation. The S stutters on the GUI, it staggers if you have games in quick resume, and it does a really poor job rendering high end games... Not to mention that it's incapable of 4k.The X has no issues, it functions flawlessly, and because it's black it just looks better in your room. In my experience it doesn't even generate that much heat, but you do need to make sure it has adequate clearance an ventilationn."
1779,LISA e.,2022,5,Well packaged and came with free games. Honestly was hesitant however would recommend.
1780,LISA e.,2022,5,Well packaged and came with free games. Honestly was hesitant however would recommend.
1781,Gavin,2020,5,Very happy to get this so early! Great system
1782,Savitar C.,2021,5,I have bought many things. Many tablets or other game systems like a switch or playstation. But this is the first time ever since I first used Amazon of nearly 10 years I can give a 5 star. It was an amazing buy. The system was indeed brand new good condition. Even put in a food box to ward off potential thieves. Would happily buy from again
1783,Victor,2021,5,"Since YouTube is one of my primary occupations, I finally decided to take the plunge and buy the Xbox Series X.  Of course, they’re still sold out all over the place, so I knew I’d have to pay a little more on Amazon in order to get one.  Fortunately, the seller’s price is what I would consider to be a fair deal.  Yes, it was still a $350 mark up, but I’ve seen others charge more than double the retail value.  Console arrived earlier than expected, and so far, it works perfectly with no issues.  Five stars!"
1784,Carlos Mirabal,2022,5,Great
1785,Matt,2020,5,Came same day as the release when I pre-ordered 2 months ago
1786,Collin,2021,5,Works good
1787,KTARRO,2022,5,"Bought to replace xbox one s... great difference in gameplay quality, graphics and response.... 100% satisfied with purchase... Recommended if you like seriously gaming"
1788,A. Yates,2020,1,"Sad to give this a poor review.  I received a launch day unit which worked for three days and apparently died overnight.  No obvious reason for the death of the system but it simply won't turn on again.  MS support is sadly poor - just a circular loop back to the same canned and deficient ""support"" page, and an option to request a repair on the unit.  Says there's 24 hour online support, but I can't actually get it for this issue.  Likely returning it instead of requesting a repair.Prior to the hardware failure I was happy with the system.  As expected, load times were quite good, games looked great and were fluid."
1789,Jo R.,2022,5,Exactly as described brand new and sealed. Even came 3 days early. Wasn't supposed to arrive till the 31st and got it before noon today.
1790,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"System works great, even pulled up my old games from the the Xbox one on my account."
1791,James Jones,2022,5,Awesome gaming console 👌🏿
1792,Sebastian Carlos,2021,5,Definitely a huge improvement over last gen xbox
1793,FloridaJay!,2020,4,"So far not super impressed with this new Xbox. Yes it’s a sexy piece of electronic and seems built solid but the lack of launch games is disappointing. I also don’t see that much of a performance difference between my Xbox one x and this as far as speed etc. maybe because it’s due to lack of games but right now, they are way behind PS5 launch. Very disappointed and not so sure it’s worth the hype.."
1794,Tori Hasty,2022,5,"I’ll be honest, when I ordered this I have expected to receive a box of breaks or something. But no it’s a real live Xbox series X! It runs super well too. I highly recommend it if you can get on the damn list."
1795,Henny kunzig,2023,5,"I bought this to replace an aging original Xbox One. Destiny 2 was starting to take up to 10 seconds to open menus and many large, outdoor maps with many enemies were getting poor frame rates. This fixed all that. Menus pop up instantly and graphics look sharper with 4k support."
1796,S. Fleming,2022,5,"I have this and play games on it, have the Game Pass, it has provided many hours of play.  I would recommend for anyone that wants one, pick one up.  This is not an ad for this one vs. that one.  Get which ever one makes you happy.  Personally I got the XBX and I am completely loving all the games, graphics, new titles."
1797,Eduardo Ibarra,2022,5,"Uno se siente más seguro comprando esta clase de productos con Amazon por la calidad y seguridad que te ofrecen frente a la competencia, sin duda volveré a comprar mi siguiente consola aquí mismo."
1798,Gerardo Esparza,2022,5,Excelente llego en dos días y funcionando al 100 ya un mes de uso y no me ha dado ningún problema
1799,JR,2022,5,Excelente consola. Se configura con la app de Xbox. Importante para cualquier compra es que se tiene que actualizar y la descarga de la actualización puede tardar dependiendo de la velocidad del internet. Por lo que si es para regalo de Navidad o de Reyes importante tomar esto en cuenta
1800,Ricardokande,2022,5,"Ahora que ya me pude hacer con la seréis X ahora sí ya cuento con las 3 consolas de las 3  compañías más grandes  de videojuegos  y puedo decir que es una excelente consola me gusta mucho su diseño ,su color  y  que es pequeña en comparación con la  PS5 y con un hardware poderoso vengo del Xbox One S y si se nota mucho  el salto  de generación con juegos como Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Resident Evil 2 Remake, Scarlett Nexus entre otros que ya están optimizados para la nueva generación , no puedo esperar a que salgan el próximo año juegos  suicide squad, Resident Evil 4 remake ,el juego de mundo abierto de Harry Potter para ver lo que es capaz está consola"
1801,Jorge Niebla,2022,5,Para Jugar Videojuegos
1802,Isaac,2022,5,"El paquete llegó a tiempo y seguro, la caja estaba ligeramente maltratada pero nada d ewue preocuparse. Hasta ahora funciona bien, me preocupaba que a algunos mencionaban que se quemaba o dejaba de funcionar. Cómo consejo tenga lo conectado a un regulador y al apagarlo háganlo desde el menú de configuración y seleccionen ""apagar completamente"" y desconectarlo si no lo usan, cubrirlo del polvo etc."
1803,Alan Gonzalez,2022,5,"Yo compre la series S hace ya un año y era muy buena consola, pero si es mas que evidente que aunque sea una consola de nueva generación si esta bastante limitada con los juegos que salen optimizados para estas consolas. compre Esta series X y les puedo decir que es un cambio ¡BRUTAL! que en verdad es muy notoria a la hora de jugar, les recomiendo ampliamente que si tienen la oportunidad o el deseo de comprar una con sola de siguiente generación y están pensando entre las series X|S elijan sin pensar la X."
1804,Arturo sennin,2022,5,"Primer reseña a 3 días de la compra... La consola cumple lo que promete, es rápida, descarga a la máxima velocidad de tu Internet, el quick resume funciona al 80% si se hace mientras descargas otros juegos, el juego abierto usa demasiados gráficos o es muy pesado se traba (en lo personal lo veo como una función innecesaria)Mi consola es Internacional y el problema que veo es que al no tener soporte técnico (garantía) me da mucho miedo le pase algo, sin embargo el xbox one S que compré, en 5 años jamás le pasó algo y si el xbox series X es la bestia que prometen no debería tener problemas, el único detalle es que al colocarla de forma horizontal se calienta de forma brutal, pero al mantenerla en forma vertical se mantiene fría."
1805,alvaro tovar alvarez,2022,5,"A tiempo y en buen estado, tengo un mes usando la consola y no a fallando."
1806,Itzel h.,2022,5,"Todo llego bien con el xbox, la verdad me preocupaba que por ser la version internacional tendria algun detalle, pero no, todo esta en perfectas condiciones, solo que no tiene garantía, pero ya lo prendi y todo funciona correctamente, es bellisimo.Lo compre en la promo del buen fin exclusivo de amazon, que es 2 dias antes del buen fin, y salio en 11500, buena promo.Adjunto fotos del Xbox"
1807,Adonnis,2022,5,"Una de las mejores consolas actuales, si vas a pasar a la nueva generación, definitivamente xbox series x es una buena opción."
1808,ManuelMuñoz,2022,5,Llego en tiempo y en buen estado!
1809,Cliente de Amazon,2022,5,Excelente
1810,Andrés Velázquez Diamamtino,2022,5,"Está es LA consola, y dependiendo de cuando la compren y el método de pago se puede conseguir a un excelente precio. El Quick resume, la resolución impecable a 4k y con buen manejo de cuadros, hace de este sistema un lujo necesario para gamers."
1811,Jorge R.,2022,5,"El diseño monolítico del equipo y la facilidad de conexión con las televisiones. Los juegos van excelente y cuenta con retro compatibilidad, por lo que puedo jugar con mis títulos del Xbox One."
1812,Jose Salaya,2022,5,"llego en super buen estado, todo completamente nuevo, la caja en perfecto estado, llego en solo menos de 24 hrs, y ningun problema todo perfecto hasta ahora llevo 3 dias con la consola, juego mas de 8 hrs al dia y cero problemas, 0 sobrecalentado y 0 ruidos"
1813,Miguel Ángel,2022,5,Me encanto el x box x
1814,Ismael,2022,5,"Es impresionante, aunque no sientes el salto de una xbox one a una series, si sientes la potencia y la fiabilidad que trae esta nueva consola. La logística de Amazon fue una porquería, el que entregaba se la queria llevar de regreso pero no se lo permití. En general en juegos normales, es perfecta en juegos que en la One soportaban 30 fps cómo halo infinite en esta puede ir hasta 60 o 120. En general una consola excelente 10/10"
1815,Jesus  R.C,2022,5,"Llego un dia antes lo cual fue excelente, totalmente sellado sin un raspon, soy coleccionista de juegos no solo gamer, desde que salio el xbox 360 decidí comprar juegos de esta compañía estaba dudoso de comprarmelo por que siempre subia de precio ahora en el prime day aproveche y lo pude hacer lo bueno es que si tienes juegos digitales de la generación pasada sea 360 o one en algún disco duro externo, solamente lo conectas y listo a jugar sin embargo algunos juegos se actualizan a su versión mas reciente, lo cual no es un problema pues si tienes buena conexión a internet esta máquina cumple lo que dice y descarga increíblemente rapido los juegos, lo malo, con los juegos optimizados de series x y s tienes que hacerte de una memoria especial seagate si no no podras jugarlos, ya que deben o estar instalados en el x box series x o en dicha memoria especial si no no los podras usar de ahi en mas excelente en graficos velocidad de carga e interfaz de usuario no se calienta y no hace ruido hasta el momento todo muy bien."
1816,Gerardo cruz,2022,5,Llego a tiempo solo estaba poquito maltratada la caja. Pero todo bien y funcional un gran cambio de un xbox one fat a xbox series X  me gusto la compra
1817,Roberto,2022,4,"solo que tuve un problema en el control pero es de parte de la fabrica, porque tengo el problema de que mi control no prende aunque este al 100 y no se me a caído solo fue de un momento para otro y me informe que a varios les a pasado así, eso es lo malo del producto nada más"
1818,Edgardo Mancillas González,2022,4,"Carga más rápido que la consola previa, tiene claridad en las imágenes y procesa los juegos más nuevos."
1819,Jimmy,2023,5,Très satisfait de mon achat!Aucunement déçu de la Xbox series x!Et ce vend à un bien meilleur prix que la PS5
1820,Víctor Justo,2022,5,"Todo bien con la xbox, llego en perfecto estado, solo la caja estaba un poco arrugada pero todo lo de adentro estaba bien y funciona de maravilla."
1821,Ricardo Fuentes Vargas,2022,5,No tuve ningún problema ni en la compra ni en la entrega. La consola está al 100 y está muy buena.
1822,Areeba Khan,2022,5,"I bought this for my brother birthday. this is really good so far and he loves it. only one thing you should know is that you have to buy games in it to play. i didnt knew it, maybe my jerk brother knew it all along but i didnt. we have to buy $70CAD fifa2022 game or many other games that cost money but there are tons of free games too. so just a heads up. otherwise this is really great and it came in approximatley 11 hrs after i ordered."
1823,Alejandro Arzate,2022,5,"Excelente compra, demoro un día mas por cuestiones de logística pero el paquete llegó bien y en excelente estado."
1824,TripleR,2023,5,Finally got the Series X at MSRP.
1825,Wm.,2022,5,Fantastic console Has everything you'd want in a current gen console . 120hz gaming is great .
1826,Luis Iván,2022,5,"Llegó en buen estado y antes de lo esperado. La consola incluye un control con baterías, cable de corriente y cable HDMI.El desempeño de la consola es increíble, no hace ruido y casi no genera calor. El desempeño gráfico es asombroso y lo mejor es el tiempo de carga, en segundos carga juegos como Forza 5 y Cyberpunk."
1827,David,2022,5,Merci à l'employer de poste Canada qui a livré ma commande un excellent service avec le sourire !
1828,Jared,2022,5,Increíble consola
1829,Darius Kearnan,2022,5,"Use it practically everyday wether it’s gaming or watching shows, Microsoft killed it on this one thing runs beautifully and was more affordable then its rival the PS5 at the time of purchase"
1830,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"I like the overall look of the machine.I owned an xboxone prior to the X and they have similar downloads for large games 75 gb takes three or four hours to download on both machines,it has better images loads of detail."
1831,Shakib,2022,5,"This one is their most reliable so far. To the point that I switched from Play Station to Xbox.AND, just ordered my own customized controller from Design Lab which is nice and smart touch. Get it and download Cyberpunk!You won’t regret it. That game is the future!Johnny Silverhand, you magnificent bastard!"
1832,richard  claude jean,2022,5,"Le produit est un des meilleurs en son genre simple graphique incroyable,disponibilité des jeux extras"

1844,Mephiskapheles6,2022,4,I like this system
1845,James,2022,5,"A great system, and the ultimate package for games is worth it to start out with 20 some games with the option to stream instead of downloading."
1846,Angelo S.,2022,5,"I purchased a series x on launch day in 2020 and it was good for a few weeks. It eventually started rebooting after 30 minutes of use. The Source’s $80 Extended warranty was voided and M$FT warranty was also voided because it was  “scratched” on its side. It appears that they just resell returned units as new and hope that the new sucker doesn’t have the same problem, if there’s a scratch then everything is voided. Anyways I waited and waited for someone else not named THE SOURCE 😡 to restock at a decent price so I wouldn’t have to trade my baby crocodile to a scalper to get it. Long story short, almost 2 years later, Amazon got it to me at a regular price and one day shipping thanks to prime! Quick load times, quiet, But very HOT! On its side it’s about 53 degrees. Standing up its 56 degrees, But at least it doesn’t restart randomly. Oh also, all the fancy buzzwords (Atmos, Dolby Vision, DTS:X) work perfectly!!! Thanks for keeping this gamer on the green (good) side. Lol"
1847,Amazon Customer,2022,5,What can i say? It has been working perfectly so far.no issue
1848,Courtney Hines,2022,5,I like the Xbox series x as I did own the Xbox series s and the xbox series x is a way better console you can see better details
1849,leo Pons,2022,5,"Original, bien sellado tal cual está descrito"
1850,william,2022,5,I bought this for my brother as a birthday gift and hes very happy with it!
1851,Dave Armstrong,2022,5,"Nice gaming system.  My son is impressed, thanks!"
1852,Hélène P.,2022,5,"Comme promis : rapide et puissante. Se configure en un claquement de doigts. Moins encombrante que je ne l'aurais cru.Le problème se situe encore au niveau de la livraison, comme toujours avec Amazon : le colis a été laissé à la portée de tous dans le hall d'un immeuble, alors que j'avais laissé des instructions concernant la livraison. Ils n'en tiennent pas compte. Déplorable."
1853,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Fast.
1854,Zackary Varey,2022,4,Some of the corners and edges are dinged but inside the package everything is protected by an insane amount of padding. I love it!
1855,Saul Rojas,2022,5,Cumplió con mis expectativas
1856,Michael m,2022,5,Good price and great game play much better then the ps5.
1857,peter,2021,4,"First delivery fast but they did not box it so miricale was not stolen it was left in the  big series x box on door steep Wich is 5 feet from curb no fence and pathway always used by people,this was stupidity plus since it was SERIESX box all there tags stickers plastered on box so now box is garbage. stupidest delivery for high end item open package everyone sees what is and leave it feet from side walk for hours after I was told no answer at door they will hold at local office .feels like x1 x nothing new use same interface so its like still I'm on a  x1 and games well its xbox they have no exclusives ,  so basic 3rd party stuff now the resume feature is amazing and best new thing to gaming .  but if you want play games cheap they have gamepass ultimate a killer deal . the extra memory is stupid its $350 Canadian after tax for 1 tb memory  and system only comes with 800 gigs usable space , so you will be deleting and re installing a lot when games like cod are 250 gigs for full install.  plus so stupid no Bluetooth so most headsets useless and speeds to dl are not great  not sure part used for internet card but compared to ps5 its slow as hell downloading and install from disk is insane slow compared to my ps5 .  controller is same nothing new but dpad style and still only company uses batteries wants us pay more for there charger something sony and Nintendo built in to there amazing controllers.  Step forward but three back if you have PC no need ever buy this all games are PC also no true exclusive like Sony, Nintendo or steam have .The memory is horrible at Sony use any memory stick simple easy way way cheaper series x 350$ for 1TB after tax in Canada, on my past I have 4gig memory cost less then half of that it was just as easy put in you plug it in simple there no excuse in 2022 have batteries for controller and no Bluetooth"
1858,Ugur Cem Decdeli,2023,5,
1859,Annie,2022,5,Livraison rapide et intact!
1860,MarquisDeSang,2022,4,"The console is amazing.Gamepass is the best gift given to gamers.Total silence when in operation.1440p 120fps works perfectly and is amazing to witness.Glad that the Xbox One controller is still compatible with the Series X.The tactile vibration in the controller and in the left and right trigger is amazing for racing games.Not only I can feel the road, I fell the ABS in my left index and the wheel spin on acceleration on my right index."
1861,William am OBrien,2022,4,"It is an awesome product you got here a little later than it said it’s supposed to have one day shipping but that’s OK. It works well didn’t come and damage controller is nice and it works perfectly. I have been playing with it for the last couple days and I really enjoy it. Thank you, Amazon, that is my only complaint that it didn’t come in when it said it would"
1862,Cornell,2022,5,I've been trying to get this system for a long time now I have one of every xbox. It's a great system.
1863,Victor Sarmiento,2022,5,"La entrega fue rápida y buena tenía un poco de daños menores la caja más en las esquinas pero por dentro la consola viene bien protegida y bueno sobre la consola es como se esperaba, perfecta."
1864,Tom Ridsdale,2022,5,"Best gaming system ever... processing speed, graphics and loading are all awesome, glad I upgraded"
1865,Flopy,2022,4,"It worked fine out of the box, I knew the basics of Xbox so this review is more about the quality of the package rather than the product itselfPackage was not damaged so I gave it 4 stars"
1866,Chad MacLean,2022,5,"It came a little earlier than I had planned, which normally is great but I was out of province. Thank god I have good neighbors. This is not a ding on Amazon or anything, but just note they are speedy. It worked fantastic, came with batteries for the controller but they were hidden a little bit. Overall a good console, definitely a bump up from my 360 and Xbox One. Price to performance is great. With Xbox Game Pass you cannot go wrong, so many options!"
1867,Rick,2022,5,Finally able to get a console at a good price. Shipping was quick and it works perfectly. Game pass with cloud gaming is the best!
1868,Mike ,2022,5,"No issues, no damage.  Just a good ole Xbox X"
1869,Cliente de Amazon,2022,5,"La tecnología que presenta esta consola, es de lo mejor a la fecha, un equipo fuera de serie, digna de jóvenes interesados en este tipo de diversiones"
1870,Josh Blandford,2022,5,Why is it better you may ask?-better controller-better exclusive games (halo for example)-game pass is better than the PlayStation equivalent-I love the aesthetic
1871,Nathan,2022,4,"The only thing I dislike about the new Xbox Series X is the UI is the same as the Xbox one. Not that it's much of an issue, I just miss the UI changes with each generation. I love combing through the new UI and checking out the new features of the console.When I turned on the SX for the first time It was very underwhelming as it felt like I just turned on my old 2013 Xbox one. The similarities stops there.This thing is an absolute beast when it comes to gaming. The visuals are absolutely insaine for the price you pay. I'm not evening getting the full power yet because I'm still on a 1080p 60fps TV.I had an Xbox One X and the SX is the perfect replacement for the One X. Feels like a massive upgrade contrary to popular belief. Don't listen to the people that say the One X is just as powerful as the SX. This is simply not the case.I'm excited to see what else comes to this console generation and I do feel like it will be a 8-10 year life span."
1872,Héctor Bello,2022,5,Súper confiable y súper bien empacado
1873,Carlin,2022,5,Got this bad boy to play new exclusives and old 360 games valid console for price range and game pass is still amazing to have recommend both
1874,Vivek Mistry,2022,5,very nice better then PS 5 👍🏻
1875,Terra Rooker,2022,5,Works perfect and is the best console ever!!
1876,Donovan331,2020,5,"The Xbox Series X addresses the Xbox One X's weakest point: speed. It has a powerful CPU in addition to its monstrous GPU and has built-in SSD. You'll be impressed with the speed from the get-go. The initial setup was super fast and it even allows you to copy settings from the cloud that it backed up from your previous console.You'll be up and running in no time, and if you are a Gamepass subscriber, you'll have great games to play such as Gears Tactics & Tetris Connected. You'll have to be patient though as they download or as you apply the Series X optimization patches. While the delay of Halo Infinite's launch left a big hole in the launch lineup, it did not really bother me as I have more than enough launch games to play. Yakuza Like a Dragon is quite fun and looks fantastic on the console. Tetris Connected, while not a graphical showcase, manages to look quite cool and flashy, and  is incredibly addicting with numerous online and solo game modes.The backwards compatibility truly shines and it is a joy going back to some of your favorite titles that perform better now with the power of the Series X. Forza Horizon 4 and Gears 5 never looked so good at 4K-60fps. The new controller is not a big change, but since I use the Elite 2 anyways, that didn't bother me all too much. I quite like how the new controller feels and it seems they made some minor yet meaningful tweaks to it overall. The bumpers seem more responsive to me and the share button is a useful addition.Looking forward to seeing what's next for this powerful console and I am very impressed with the overall package so far.  Cheers"
1877,Frog Husband,2022,5,The Console works great keeps cool has lots of fan's in it. Comes with 2 Terabytes of memory which is a bonus! Shipping was fast and easy. Delivery Guy was nice and knocked at my door didn't throw my package this time! Woot Delivery was fast and easy got to even track my package!  It was quick wasted no time in getting here! Five star service and thanks for doing business Stay safe and secure during these hard times!
1878,Erik Alberto Ponce Durán,2022,5,"Muy buena, en perfectas condiciones"
1879,Trevor Debruyn,2022,5,"I feel lucky that I was able to snag one of these consoles at the fair retail price (instead of being price-gouged by scalpers). Even more so, now that my ISP has finally installed fibre optic in my neighbourhood. I recommend a gigabit internet plan and hardwiring the Xbox directly to the modem with a CAT7 ethernet cable. I held off reviewing this Xbox until I had a TV that supported HDR and could display at 4K120. It also helped that the next-gen update optimized for Xbox Series X was recently released for the Cyberpunk 2077 game. Now that I have my new 55"" OLED TV setup (2022 model), I am able to test the true power of this console. I am impressed! Gaming at 4K120 is smooth as butter and looks amazing!"
1880,Alan Roberto,2022,5,Llego en buen estado y en 3 días después de mi compra. Y a hasta ahora no he tenido problemas con ella solo tengo un mes con ella.
1881,Travis Plugoway,2022,5,"The load time is so much faster that the Xbox one!Paired with the right TV, the graphics are phenomenal 👌"
1882,khoiman,2022,4,You can use old storage drives from your xbox one but you must use the xbox approved storage card to hold any of the X\S optimized games. This is a big problem because the Xbox series X only has 1TB of storage and the storage card only has 2TB of storage. I don't see how you're gonna fit most or even a quarter of the series X library over the coming years.
1883,Liam J.P.R.,2022,5,"I got lucky and happened to be online and looking when a restock happened. I had this in my wishlist which helped. I got this directly from Microsoft Canada through Amazon for the retail price of $599 Canadian. You can't get a gaming computer this powerful for near this price. It plays my Cities Skylines so much better than my Xbox One S it's crazy! Fast boot and quick to load games this really is the next generation.One side note & I don't know if this is just the controller I got, but the home button requires more noticeably more force to react than the One S controllers I have. Still an amazing machine I'll enjoy for decades to come!"
1884,Lorenzo Ouellet,2022,5,"Awesome experience,super crisp and seamless 4k gaming for hours in a row.I've owned the series S for quite a bit now,but the series X really made a difference in terms of internal storage and picture quality.Both consoles are great though.Definitely recommend the Series X if you are a professional gamer guys."
1885,Eclipse,2022,5,Came quick and had no damage. Works great and great price. Thanks Amazon
1886,Bukszz,2022,5,"La caja llegó algo golpeada, pero todo en excelentes condiciones !"
1887,Sergio López,2022,5,Es una buena consola con excelentes gráficas
1888,Ibrahym,2022,5,El producto llegó en menos de 24 horas y en excelentes condiciones.
1889,Ruben,2022,5,Exclente
1890,Alex Z,2022,5,The easiest Xbox to set up so far - absolutely no fuss. I upgraded from an Xbox one and the speed difference when downloading games and playing is quite incredible. The 4k video is noticeably sharper. Good purchase all around. And I was pleased to see Amazon listed as an authorized dealer!
1891,Martin,2022,5,"Excelente entrega, excelente producto."
1892,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"Rien a dire sur cette console. Elle est belle, ne fait aucun bruit. Rapide et vraiment puissante. Une belle machine pour passer de superbes moments. Le Xbox game pass rajoute un avantage monstre."
1893,Adam ,2022,3,"Just the console, not a 100 other items you do not want and need to pay up for.My console came slightly damaged  - I did not want to return it because well it was hard enough to get, and amazon failed to offer me any form of discount or compensation for the damage. Customer service let me down.It is a series x...so yeah if you want one and can get this in stock it will save you a lot of $. Overall the console is very clunky and runs awful compared to my PS5 but hopefully they'll remedy it with some UI and software updates. Disappointing when you pay so much for something which lags opening up its side menu and is plagued by awful software and UI. The potential is there but it is not well executed. A $700 console should not freeze and crash opening the side menu...or randomly boot you from games. Sheer laziness on Microsoft for using the same exact UI as the Xbox one. Controller sucks compared to the PS5s dualsense but has been slightly revamped over last gen, but nothing to celebrate really still feels cheap and they ask a premium price for it ."
1894,Vijay Ramkissoon,2020,4,"Firstly, if you are unable to get your hands on a Series X, be patient and keep checking the online stock. When I got this system I was impressed by the small size and the overall design that keeps everything subtle and cool, looks are going to be subjective but I like the way the Series X looks. After upgrading from an Xbox One, I am thankful for a simple power cord and no brick, the included HDMI 2.1 cable, and the new controller is like the old one so usability is great.The SSD is obviously an issue and expanding the space with the proprietary expansion is quite expensive at the moment, luckily the Series X recognized my old 4TB hard drive with Xbox One games, and it was really easy from then on to manage my games. I have Series X/S enhanced titles on the internal SSD while everything else is playable from the external hard drive.The issue I have is that there are no real titles here that can sell this console, missing is the one or two console release games that really show off what this system can do and that's why ""next-gen"" isn't quite here yet. If you're planning on getting a Series X or S anyway, I highly recommend Xbox Gamepass because it has a lot of games and titles like Forza Horizon 4 that are enhanced for the Series X/S and look and play amazingly well."
1895,Michel,2022,4,Performance definitely there. Love the blue ray player.
1896,Daniel,2022,5,Will waited patiently for this bad boy and finally snagged one few days ago. Got really lucky considering how hard it is to even get a chance to see it in stock just for few min. Only took few days to receive it at my house. Amazing shipping. Now I'm enjoying a great system Xbox ever made. Just too bad that the dang scalpers are ruining everyones hope of getting one without paying doubling or even tripling the price. Thank goodness I lucked out by buying straight on Amazon and avoided those crooks. Wish everyone else luck on this it's really worth the wait.
1897,Solid ice43,2022,5,"Arrived ahead of schedule, came as shown, and works perfectly."
1898,Mark E,2022,5,"I mean I don't think there is anything to say that probably hasn't been said. Likely you sit on either the Xbox Side or the PlayStation side. I personally enjoy them both. This is a great console, and xbox game pass makes it easy to have a lot of games immediately available to you. Great console and great games. Although I do prefer Sony's exclusives more than the Xbox Exclusives but Xbox does have great games"
1899,A Canadian Person,2020,5,"If you’ve owned any Xbox One since 2013, using this Xbox doesn’t require any new learning of a new OS, which some might find as an annoyance since we are used to brand new OS’s with the launch of a new console. Plugging in an external HDD from my last Xbox One comes with the immediate access to all my previously installed games, which makes using the console immediately, much easier. Using Xbox Series X enhanced patches requires that you either copy or re-install the game to the internal SSD or Seagate Expansion SSD (which I don’t have). I was a bit disappointed to see that game installing is still dramatically slower than my PC with similarly equipped specs, but it is still an upgrade over the Xbox One models. Playing Xbox Series X enhanced games with an HDR display look awesome. They are remarkably sharp and the colours look vivid with performance I could only previously achieve on my significantly more expensive custom built PC. For the retail price of $599 Canadian, I can say that as a PC Gamer, this console is well worth the price, especially when paired with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (which I was surprised to see no code in the box for)."
1900,Red,2020,5,"Purchased straight from Amazon on release day. Was surprised to see that they had the Xbox in stock (had no intention of buying on release day due to my limited luck in these things). Pretty happy with my purchase.So far I've installed Call of Duty Cold War and the game looks really great on my 4K TV. I upgraded directly from the regular Xbox One 500gb so there's an enormous difference between that and the Series X. The Series X boots up instantly, there's practically no wait times for any loading screens, and best of all there is no lag for once. You could feel how outdated my regular Xbox One became.Yes there is basically no games out for the system right now. Yes the PS5 is cooler because they redesigned the controller and have some decent games out right now. That being said, I purchased this Xbox for Halo so I'm just waiting for that. Is the console worth $599? Depends if you're okay with spending the money. Otherwise just wait it out with your Xbox One X or PS4 Pro for now. Don't pay scalper money please (it's not worth like 1 grand lol)"
1901,jennifer,2022,5,I'm so happy with my new Xbox. So much faster.
1902,Tommy Ouyang,2022,5,Nice product and good price!!! Easy to use!!!
1903,Crinkcant,2021,5,"I had a Xbox One fat and now, it’s completely different experience! I will not describe all the specs and feature of the console but it’s work very great. I will only talk about the problems i had:A) Only had 1 bug in 1 month and a half. The console reboot by itself and it was correct right after.B) Quick Resume is weird sometimes. Some game dont like that, like EA games, they dont want to connect you to their server after a couple of hours. Sometime, you need to restart the game but the SSD is very fast so it’s much faster than a Xbox One anyway.C) In Hitman 2, on 4K mode, I’ve seen some FPS drop if i have too many dead bodies (like 50 bodies in on the screen) but usually, even in a crowded area, that’s 60 FPS.5 stars. I can’t say that these problems was big and it’s quite normal, even for a big PC build."
1904,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Gaming at its finest
1905,Patrick Brunk,2022,5,Arrived quickly and in good condition. No problems so far
1906,Skies 13,2022,5,Great upgrade.  Best value for games with the game pass.
1907,Mauricio Dias Mendes,2022,5,"c'est tout ce que je m'attendais, la qualité est là et c'est le fun"
1908,Nic V,2022,5,After finally being able to get my hands on one of these I can say my expectations were met and then some. Usually I would opt to upgrade my PC but at the prices we are seeing a single GPU for you can rest assured at this price point the gaming value of a Series X or even a Series S is very good. Use a stock tracker and don't give up. Took me three or four months of trying but I did finally get one through Amazon.
1909,Changho Eugene Joe,2022,5,it was not damaged at all when it came and it was really easy to get hang of the settings
1910,Rod Senger,2022,5,"From the outside of the packaging to the set-up and first use, this purchase was well worth the $$"
1911,Kane Comeau,2021,4,"Well. I finally got an Xbox Series X at MSRP…and it’s okay. It claims you can do 120 FPS but it would be nice to see an FPS counter embedded in the games or onto the dashboard itself. Maybe it’s because I’m playing at 60Hz. But some games that are apparently optimized for X|S have hitches and frame drops. You can literally see it with your eyes. I did notice a difference when I turned Game Mode on though. Like I said, maybe this is because I’m using 60Hz. Maybe once I get 120Hz, it will be at it’s full potential. The design is decent and the new hardware is nice. It would be nice to maybe have a new dashboard update. After playing for awhile, I can say I’m enjoying it. I just need a 120Hz TV to really see the difference.Update: After changing my TV to Game Mode. I’ve noticed a difference. So I changed my review."
1912,justin,2022,5,"It works wasn't stolen, paid retail price."
1913,Nathaniel Currie,2022,5,Been looking for one every where glad I finally got mine and so happy with it
1914,SynthSwan,2022,5,I own both the Series S and X & I have to say the difference between consoles is substantial. The Series X is much more powerful delivering everything Xbox’s Phil Spencer said it would.
1915,Client d'Amazon,2022,4,"Après deux ans d'attente (pour la payer à un prix raisonnable...), j'ai finalement obtenu ma console XBox !Le graphisme est incroyable, les joueurs plus vrais que les vrais. Des heures de plaisir sont à venir !"
1916,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Coming from an orginal 2013 Xbox One the Series X is an amazing upgrade.Games load in seconds, quick resume is a great feature allowing me to game surf like never before. 1 TB of space is a huge amount I currently have 15 games loaded the majority AAA.This has been the most affordable generation change ever, I didn't have to buy a 2nd controller as all my Xbox one devices are compatable. Gamepass is such a huge value allowing me to play brand new games like Gears Tactics and Tetris Connected and load up Series X upgraded games like Gears 5, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 4. I haven't had to spend anything on games and can wait until some of the launch lineup goes on sale.Playing game in 4k and especially 60 FPS is so nice. I feel so grateful to be one of the lucky ones to get this at launch. Thank you Amazon Canada for the flawless purchase and shipping. This has not been the case with a lot of retailers including your American counterpart. I'm so grateful."
1917,Grayson,2022,5,Wasn’t damaged at all and works well still after having it for a while.
1918,Howie Love,2020,5,The Xbox series X is the gold standard for gaming.It loads games in seconds and boots up super fast. Playing a 4K is beautiful as long as you have the appropriate TV or display. And your media apps are all available to view and work as expected.The system is packaged very well from Microsoft and it is a pleasure to open and wield protected. Out of the box it comes with everything you need.Setup is easy and fast with the Xbox app for smart phones. You will be up and running in a few short minutes.The system runs cool and Quiet! It is a huge improvement from last generation. You will need to make sure your entertainment unit has enough room for proper airflow or place it beside or behind your TV.The only con so far is the power cable is a little on the short side but definitely not to small but a longer cable could add flexibility for placement considering it’s size.
1919,Freedom Lemay,2022,5,I mean it’s the newest Xbox lol it works perfectly and arrived super fast for a good price
1920,Jesse,2022,5,"This is by far the best console that I have ever owned. Powerful, fast and overall amazing"
1921,Jay,2022,5,Haven’t had an Xbox since the 360 but I’m loving this machine so far. Recommend this to anyone.
1922,Jacques JR Duteau,2022,5,Le produit à arriver dans la boîte origine et ma Xbox Série X vas très bien . merci Amazon
1923,Micheal Snyder,2022,5,Showed up when it was supposed to.  Out preforms my old Xbox one with flying colours.  And I didn’t have to stand in line or be put on a wait list.  Get it.
1924,Ryan Mark,2022,5,Love it. I always wanted an Xbox x and now I have one.
1925,johny pogo,2022,5,A nice console
1926,U of T Statistics,2022,3,"The new version of PS4 Had a better Software and the controller at least has a rechargeable battery not AA.In terms of content, there are more games on PS than Xbox. Even though PS4 has HDR support at HD (not 4K), the difference in visual aesthetics isn't really noticeable.Given the few games on Xbox and the controller lacking rechargeable batteries, the PS4 (as old as it might be) remains a better alternative."
1927,C.Man,2022,5,"Played 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. 4k. Quality mode. Absolutley amazing picture and detail, games have come along way. I can't wait for more high end games to come along."

1930,Catherine Juneau,2022,5,so happy to finally have one
1931,Pinz,2020,5,"The ability to switch between games quickly is wonderful. Knowing MS they will keep tweaking and updating the UI over time. The loading times are so much better, even for older games. I used to wait over 30 seconds every time I fast travelled somewhere, and now it’s like 5 seconds or less.For most people the Series S will be fine, but if you sit close to your TV or really need that 4K resolution, then this is the way to go. Considering Series X has more storage, and the storage sticks are expensive, it’s better to pay more upfront now for the space AND get a better console. I think games will only increase in size, and being able to hold 5-10 compared to 10-20 is a big difference."
1932,HomeDaddy,2020,5,"I had a real hard to securing an xbox series x, but thankfully I found it in stock on amazon! It was shipped quickly and I received it in a few days! Very happy with amazon's service and speediness.  The xbox is awesome, playing games in 4k 60fps is something I wanted since seeing it first hand. The difference between 30fps to 60fps is amazing and makes everything so much smoother. I can't wait to try out 120fps once I get a game that supports it!  No idea what that will be like!  The xbox is quiet, does not overheat and is a dream to play. This next gen upgrade is amazing! Can't wait to try out cyberpunk 2077 when it comes out next week!"
1933,NLFreezeDried,2021,5,This thing is a behemoth - in all the right ways. Not to mention physically haha.Mega fast. No brainer when deciding to upgrade. The S model is poop compared to this. Save or spend the extra cash whether it be here or eb games / gamestop. (Xbox one x has a good trade value up to like $200 currently if sold out online  and looking to save a few bucks but having 2 consoles is amazing on so many levels I recommend not trading haha).Enjoy!  :)
1934,Chelsey Young,2022,5,Just recently upgraded from the Series S to the X. Happy to finally see this in stock after trying to purchase one for a while. Love the performance power. Nice next gen console.
1935,Alexandre B.,2022,5,Anazing product
1936,bear,2020,5,I'm very happy with this buy! The shipping with Prime was extremely fast and I'm so glad I don't have to buy a new TV stand to make it fit nicely. I was worried it would be too tall and bulky to fit [it looked a lot like a desktop computer tower in photos and ads] but it fits perfectly on its side where my old Xbox One was. My Xbox One's processor used to struggle with certain games and apps but the Series X runs them beautifully. It indeed plays all my Xbox One games but I can't wait for the new ones to come out so I can experience the full system.
1937,Josue Rivera,2021,5,"If you are able to get your hands on the xbox it is a great system. very quick on every aspect although if you do not have a TV that can support it, you will not be able to experience the full range of the xbox. 4k at 120 fps is the optimal performance that the xbox can currently be used at. My tv has the ability for this although it does not have the proper HDMI port of 2.1. MY tv has 2.0 which can only support 4k at 60 fps or 2048 at 120 fps. so this is something to pay attention too!"
1938,Avi,2021,4,It’s a nice device but I would rate the PS5 more. It lacks not in power or speed but in terms of good games that PS5 has kept as exclusive. Of course Xbox has its own variety of games.The device itself is pretty smooth. I only faced a device freeze once. But it’s smoother than PS to play and all around other features combined with a gaming device make it super awesome. I just love the simplicity of it. I have always been a PS person but I’m quite happy with my Xbox!
1939,MS,2020,5,True 4K Gaming Experience!Played COD Warzone at 120fps and it amazed me how powerful the console is.  The size of the XSX is also perfect. The huge fan is extremely quiet. I can barely hear anything even it is working at 100% loading. The only thing I don’t feel as good as my PlayStation 5 is the controller. The DualSense of PS5 brings the next gen gaming to a whole new level. Really really hope Microsoft will update the controller soon! Right now I will buy And play a cross platform game on PS5 if the game is using dualsense until XSX gets a real next gen controller.
1940,DKaiser,2022,5,"Happy to get this, to me you need game pass to make it worth while over ps5"
1941,Amazon Customer,2021,4,"I received this xbox and was blown away by the speed, but I couldn't play any Series X games on it as they kept crashing and shutting the console down, so I had to send it in for repair to Microsoft within first week of use.I did not have the previous Xbox one so this was a huge upgrade.Cons:No Games, but coming from the 360, I picked up a lot of games I missed from the Xbox One, which I thought were impressive to pass time until actual games for the Series X come out."
1942,Kevin Collin,2022,5,xbox gamepass very nice
1943,Ahmed Savvy Reviewer,2021,5,"The Console sizes actually much much smaller than what it shows online and in pictures and it's very quiet, great entry for the next gen consoles. I was so happy to carry over my save data from my Xbox one X to the new gen with no problems. Game selections are great as well with Xbox game pass it's really amazing you have a variety of over 100 games to play it could last you for ages and ages. Price tag is not bad at all"
1944,Vincent,2022,5,"Great shipping, 3-4 days at my door, not complicated… perfect!"
1945,joshua Zavitz,2020,5,"Runs cool, runs quiet, and it's a powerhouse for the value. Everything I expected and more. Running assassins creed valhalla 4k at 60fps locked is freaking cathartic. Load times are practically non existent, not having to wait between loading screens helps maintains immersion like I didn't expect.DO NOT BUY FROM SCALPERS, they are scum of the earth opportunists. Wait a couple months for the farse to end and grab one in store. Would be soooooo satisfying if all these jackasses ended up stuck with consoles they can't sell, that way it puts them in the hole."
1946,ekim1129,2022,5,The Series X with Game Pass is the way to go.
1947,Melissa Montgomery,2022,5,"Arrived earlier then estimated , perfectly delivered and not a scratch on the box. Where your dreams grow."
1948,Samuel,2022,5,Perfect
1949,Adeel S,2021,3,"The SSD is the biggest improvement in the new Xbox. It's unbelievably fast at loading apps and games compared to the Xbox One and the Xbox One X as well.But unfortunately there's not a whole lot more to look forward to with this XSX just yet. No new exclusive titles that really challenge the hardware and the home screen UI is unchanged from the old gen and still 1080p. There are new bugs to contend with like the controller just disconnecting itself completely from the Xbox, and some apps no longer work well. There are some screen popping and HDR issues on certain TVs as well. And they've killed the Kinect entirely. Even though the UI is the EXACT same on this new XSX, it doesn't support the Kinect even if you have all of the connectors needed to hook it up.All of the great things about Xbox are still there on the older consoles too..."
1950,Marco,2022,5,Produit comme indiquer
1951,Anthony,2022,5,à quelque seconde après l'avoir acheté il n'en restait plus. Je suis content de mon achat et je passe de bon moment avec Le game pass en plus :)
1952,Sang,2021,5,"Going from Xbox One S to the Series X is almost night and day. High refresh rate, Xbox one X enhanced games, quick resume, fast loading, and just better performance overall. Controller feels great and probably my favourite one so far, only thing that’s annoying is that the Y button isn’t super responsive, not sure if it’s a minor defect or all the controllers have it but that’s the only downside (it won’t ruin the gaming experience). Once these consoles get a restock, definitely try to snag this."
1953,Evan B.,2022,5,Finally got one!
1954,Simon Cinq-Mars,2022,5,Tout était parfait!
1955,Dave,2022,5,recu le lendemain de l'achat super content des heures de fun garantie
1956,weywey,2022,5,I’m new to Xbox and I should say it’s perfect for me to experience 4k games. the graphics are awesome. Delivery is perfect!
1957,Lynda,2022,5,It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Still using it out every day with no issues
1958,Evan,2021,5,"This is a beast of a machine and quiet as hell. I play warzone with friends who have $2000 computers and this is faster in loading the game up. I'm rolling at 120hz at 1440p (my tv can't support 4k at 120hz unfortunately, only 60hz).When I play single player I use 60hz at 4k and man the graphical upgrade is amazing. Also love gamepass as $90 per game is ridiculous."
1959,Jean-Marc Roussel,2022,5,J'ai joué à Halo Infinite et les graphiques sont incroyables!
1960,Alex,2022,5,Love this console amazing and fast shipping as well
1961,Jay,2021,5,"I was able to get my hands on one of these fairly early thanks to this seller. Glad they had them in stock, since you know, all the scalping was going on.works like a charm, and I'm glad to get back to playing halo."
1962,Mike Tomson,2021,5,"Paid extra for the series x, but 100% worth the money. Graphics and power are amazing.There is a worldwide chip shortage because of COVID-19, so I don’t expect the price of an Xbox to sell at standard price, or more units to become available any time soon.Very happy with purchase!"
1963,Nate G,2022,5,Cant believe how fast the load times are.Graphics are insane.Gamepass is a game changerSo happy!!
1964,Constantino,2021,5,"The future is here in gaming. Honestly said I will only order off Amazon for ther amazing delivery service.  Coming from ps4 to Xbox x, I'm very excited. Definitely xbox came out to impress this year. One thing is for sure. Ita not light  it's pretty heavy. Quality is amazing.  We need more next gen gameplay"
1965,TDot2020,2020,5,Incredible machine. Sets up in a flash. The App is key for easy set up. Feels so smooth. HDR is incredible for upscaling games. Nice to have 800gb and purchasable expandable memory now.Obvious drawback are games. We need more. BUT the upscaling with game pass and HDR allows you to rediscover old games which is awesome.Playing the Xbox Series X with the Elite 2 controller and Arctis SteelSeries 9X is a transcendent experience. Truly the Ferrari of gaming.And it’s not THAT big compared to a Day 1 Xbox One.
1966,Brendyn,2020,5,"Had to wait a couple days after launch for it even after ordering it on day one (September 22nd) but I didn’t mind as it was still the earliest I’ve ever bought a next gen console. I’ve been loving it so far and will only get better once next gen games actually come out in numbers.I have the PS5 as well and have to say, I’ve had significantly less early adopter glitches on the Xbox. Great work Microsoft !"
1967,Muhammad,2022,5,Highly Recommend Absolute powerhouse
1968,Joshua,2021,5,"Obviously it is the most powerful console on the market, great machine and I have had absolutely no problems with it. However, it needs more games that are truly ""next-gen"". It needs more games designed specifically for this hardware, not backwards compatible garbage. Forget the Xbox One, bring out games for the new console only like it used to be back in the glory days of gaming on console."
1969,Ye Old Lazy Buyer,2020,5,I really enjoy using the new Xbox series X. It was easy to setup (requiring an app was interesting) and the 4K experience is brilliant.I do miss the one guide experience though. It just made things easy to go from IPTV box to Xbox one output without the projector having to switch inputs. Most people won’t miss it.The existing Xbox one content runs/loads faster and it is hard to go back onto the old Xbox one now.
1970,Jenny Leigh,2022,5,I paid over 2x the retail price but it was the real deal and so far everything is legit.
1971,wyattearp38,2022,5,parfait livraison rapide et xbox neuf scellé !
1972,Anastasios P.,2022,5,"Great buy, Love it when Amazon has this in stock. I know many others that are also looking for this"
1973,Reviewermanperson,2021,5,"The Series X is perfect, like mostly everyone else says. All I'll say is in regards to the Amazon purchase experience. It shipped promptly.The console box was dented and a little messy, which I didn't like to see.Still, I got to use my Amazon gift cards so I'm happy."
1974,Brennan,2022,5,love what microsoft is doing. This is one of the best consoles I have ever had
1975,Jamie,2020,4,"Just love it but like everything have bought on amazon last 2 months 2 day shipping took over a week was mad as my self from trusting amazon with my preorder of a system, don't make same mistake as me when preordering video games and system there many places out there that ship on time and don't even charge you  $7.95  month from that service"
1976,Kaellum Friesen,2022,5,"I expected it to be great and it was, not disappointed. Much faster than the Xbox One."
1977,Ilyas Farhat,2022,5,Everything runs smooth. Crazy how smooth games are and how fast they load (better than my 3000 CAD rig)
1978,joelcannell,2022,2,"The Xbox is fine, so 2 stars. But I'm deducting 3 stars because it arrived on my doorstep unwrapped! Thankfully it wasn't stolen but the Xmas morning surprise is blown. Oh well"
1979,Kevin Mackenzie,2021,4,The box was banged up a bit and it showed up a day late but other then that it was a good purchase
1980,Craig S Mooney,2022,5,Amazing system…..sold out quickly. Thankfully I was one of the buyers able to purchase.
1981,Devin,2022,5,Works great and was delivered quickly and safely in a non-descript box.
1982,Quinn Amero,2022,5,Console was easy to set up and is very quick and freest graphics. 10/10
1983,S Pirani,2021,5,"The series x is great. Graphics are awesome, load times are quick, and the new controller improves on the xbox one controller’s design. Very happy with the system."
1984,Dave,2022,5,Achez avec gamepass j'y joue plus que ma ps5
1985,Wendel Fisher,2020,5,"This game console has 12 teraflops - that's almost 10 times as many teraflops as my previous game console (the Xbox One, which only had 1.4 teraflops). Needless to say, I won't be needing any additional teraflops for quite some time, as this game console more than satisfies my need for teraflops. Highly recommended if you are in need of 12 teraflops (or, 12 trillion flops)."
1986,MARC-ERIC TREMBLAY,2022,5,
1987,Xavier,2022,2,I turned on the console and something blew up inside and I could smell something burning. Now it won’t turn on at all
1988,James Bergamin,2020,5,"It's an Xbox! Just like the one I was using every day before I got this one! But better! Like, way better! I'm honestly still just thrilled to have gotten one. It shipped to me in like three days and now I'm in the next gen. Not much more to say than ""bring on the new games!"""
1989,Andre VU,2021,4,"Peu de jeux interessants pour le moment. Aussi des bugs sur l'interface et le hardware comme les prises usb qui ne rechargent pas sans faire un reset factory de la console.Par contre, silencieuse et relativement robuste."
1990,Brad,2021,5,Was a die hard PlayStation fan boy since ps2. This is my first Xbox console and I have not been disappointed. So many games with game pass. I’m catching up on some Xbox exclusives. I’m simply amazed
1991,Mitch,2022,5,Good Product
1992,Bob D,2021,5,Ordered Wednesday and received Sunday.Very happy with the shipping.  Great packaging.So far loving the series X.  Much faster than previous consoles. Great deal from Amazon.
1993,Carter,2020,5,I was lucky enough to acquire an Xbox Series X on release day off of Amazon. And I must say I have been thoroughly delighted. The speeds are absolutely incredible and the menu is snappy and instant. Using my Xbox one s now feels ancient and I couldn’t be more happy. Exclusives don’t mean everything folks!
1994,Travis,2020,5,This console runs smooth as silk 4k ready  with extremely fast load times due to the on board SSD . This system requires a internet connection for initial setup. This console runs hot so have it in a well ventilated or open space. ( Mine smelt like burning plastic for about 3 hours seems fine now tho)
1995,DAVID E. HARROP,2020,4,Likes - speed and quality of video on all games.Dislikes - irregular shape makes installation into rack a nightmare.Controller should come with a rechargeable batteries - a cheap out!Console vent is always exhausting very hot air. Expected more games to be backwards compatible.
1996,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Absolutely loving the Series X. Upgrading from a Xbox One S and the differences in graphics and performance are really noticeable. Games run really smooth and look a 100x better than previous gen. Quick resume is one of the best features where you can have multiple games open and swap between them without loading in.
1997,SM,2022,1,"Despite multiple attempts with following the troubleshooting process on my games crashing, none worked, thought it might just be one game in particular but it crashes on all games that are optimized for X/S, so it’s basically an overpriced  Xbox one as that’s the only games it can play that doesn’t crash within seconds of playing (I can get maybe a solid hour before Xbox one games crash). Contacted Amazon and despite it saying on the website that I’m eligible to send in my product and get a replacement, you cannot…. Very disappointed and now scared to try and order another one from here and experience the same thing. At least I can return it and get a refund, but I won’t get that money back for up to a month. Which means I won’t be able to get the console for another month. Not happy. Also the product was just placed in a larger box with no packing paper which made it have lots of room to tumble around. I’d recommend getting the product in store if you can, or role the dice here, and maybe you’ll get a working one, but I did not"
1998,Jimmy Short,2020,5,A great purchase!This machine is super fast and quite. The games look fantastic. Setup was a breeze with the xbox app. Gamepass is amazing with a large variety of games.  Love the look of this machine. Zero issues with the system. Very impressed and can't think of a negative.
1999,Jarvie,2021,5,The kid loves  it
2000,Ash,2020,5,To start off with I see a lot of post that say this is a scam etc. To clear the air. There are people that can resell through amazon just be weary of who you're purchasing from. I purchased this directly from Microsoft throguh amazon at 599$ CAD. I did also have to purchase a tv for the full experience samsung Q70 hdmi 4 supports 2.1 hdmi and 4k. The Q80 &Q90 do support this also if you were wondering.The xbox does give calibration options for your TV.The walk through at the beginning is really key for the experience.Yes we were short handed because xbox delayed all their new game releases but system functionality wise SO FAR is great. I will Update this once I've played some games just to advise of my full experience.
2001,Max,2022,5,👍
2002,Patrick M,2021,5,Last system l bought was the original XBox (2004ish). Lots of cool features - still haven't figured them all out.  Setup was super easy. Looking forward to sending some quality time breaking it in.
2003,Justin,2021,5,"Bought this new console for my little brother for his birthday.He loves spending time playing on the tv.We still have to buy more games, that is family friendly so my sisters can play too.Lovely product great right out the box"
2004,Denzil,2021,4,Works like a charm!
2005,Ashar,2021,5,"Quick resume, fast with game pass makes it one of the best console. I have both Ps5 and xbox. Gamepass on xbox is way par than ps now on Ps5."
2006,Will,2021,5,Yep it’s what you expect it’s an Xbox if you expect anything else it would be Shrek box
2007,Jay800r,2021,5,No issue with the series x so far. Love the upgrades!
2008,Andre Bruce,2021,5,Couldn't believe I grabbed one. Trick is I saw a guy selling it on the FB market. So I investigated as to where he may have bought it. And Bing Bang boom.
2009,Kevin,2021,5,"The best console ever! I’m an Xbox player since the first one came out and got pretty much all of them on release day! The XSX is by far the best one, looking really nice and performing beyond expectations!"
2010,Spencer,2020,4,Amazon was great for providing the console and I give this a 4 star because I have noticed the fan make a loud noise but it has gone away.
2011,Pierre Leboeuf,2021,5,"Finally got a new gen console. It's so powerful compared to my ps4, also the gamepass is a very neat thing. Very good piece of technology :)"
2012,Allie B,2020,5,No issues getting my new console through amazon. It was a bit delayed as I bought mine on launch day but only by a week. Great new console with amazing specs. The processing speed alone was worth the switch for me.
2013,Jc,2021,5,The best console.
2014,Julianne,2020,4,L’appareil était en bon était et fonctionne bien malgré avoir été expédié directement dans sa boîte d’origine qui est arrivée pleine de bosses et d’égratignures.
2015,Ubaidullah Niaz,2020,5,First of all I'm so happy I was sable to secure one of these. Anyways when you think next gen console this it. Loading times are way faster then my old xbox one and games look fantastic on my 4k monitor.
2016,alekshi,2020,4,You get what you pay for. Such a great looking product and the spec upgrades from previous years is very evident. Gameplay has never been better!
2017,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Amazing product, did you know you can float a ping pong ball while you are gaming. A fun thing to do. Works as a mini heater too great for feet warming. Just glad that it was super easy to order"
2018,Ashton,2021,5,Console works great. It boots up fast and is relatively silent. It also arrived quickly in good condition.
2019,Fletcher,2021,5,"Fonctionne à merveille!Très rapide et très puissante console.J'adore le feeling de la manette.Et avec le Game Pass Ultimate, c'est le pied!10/10"
2020,Tyler Bickford,2021,5,"Arrived sooner than I expected, but everything was in tip top shape."
2021,Alex,2021,5,All Xbox’s have issues at launch but it’s gotten much better and is better than PS5
2022,Ryan Fontyn,2020,5,"Glad Amazon came through with the series x (only one day after launch). What a powerful system! Nothing but a great experience using this thing so far. Extremely quiet, low heat output and lightning fast. Looks great too!"
2023,Garry,2021,5,Great console for gaming.
2024,Mat,2020,5,Got my Xbox a few days after launch and have had no complaints so far! Love the speed and quick resume feature. My TV also supports 4K and 120hz so games look amazing on it.
2025,Shahid Hussain,2021,5,Just to say i wasn't sure about ordering an Xbox from Amazon but can't complain. Everything is good and the shipping was great.
2026,D,2021,5,What's not to like? Runs old games wonderfully and lots of potential in the upcoming ones.
2027,nathan lau,2020,4,Not a huge upgrade from the previous gen. Currently not too many next gen games out right now.
2028,Noah Potter,2021,5,Fast shipping
2029,2Pac,2021,5,I love it!! Also came in early. The company that delivered it should think about using heat in the truck the system was half frozen.
2030,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"This is by far the best Xbox.I came from a One X, and the Series X loads so much faster and runs smoothly.Gaming at 4K 120fps is amazing!"
2031,Mojomojo,2021,2,"This console release is even worse than the PS5 in the sense that it has even less future exclusives. They are trying to price this at a lower rate to compete, but the reality is that after 2 months, you can see that the PS5 is in much higher demand than the XSX. They are smarter about the material since they use matte black, which is way better than some cheap gloss black on the PS5. The issue is the design of this, it is literally a rectangular box. If there's somewhere that you can put it without needing to look at it on a daily basis, that is fine. Otherwise, it's a box sitting around.The performance of this is also not as great as the PS5, but it seems like every generation Microsoft is just a touch behind. Without a current list of exclusive released yet, you are better off staying with the older generation machines until more games come out or stick with a PC."
2032,Hope,2021,5,"I like the Xbox, so much faster to load games than the Xbox One S, like amazingly fast.  Very happy with it."
2033,Todd M,2020,5,No new games but the system is very fast makes my older games fun to play again. Doesn’t feel like a next generation yet but knew that going in I have no regrets.
2034,Alex,2021,5,La collection de consoles est presque complète.
2035,Simon,2020,5,"Une console merveilleuse , silencieuse et fonctionne très bien pour le moment . Je n'ai eu aucun problème avec aucun jeu . Le temps de chargement courts font tellement de bien !!"
2036,Noone,2021,4,Xbox is xbox.
2037,AF,2021,5,Great product
2038,Elaine,2020,5,"Device ordered is exactly as expected, however packaging was a little lacking.  The Xbox was moving inside the shipping box as filler was only placed on one side of the box."
2039,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Excellent system. I have always owned PS, however made the switch to play with my kids as they have Xbox. Game pass ultimate provides a large library to play. Highly recommend!"
2040,Human man,2020,5,"Just had mine delivered today, setup was easy. I have been playing AC valhalla on my one x until this one arrived. And the difference is night and day, truly stunning."
2041,Amazon Customer,2020,4,The controller can be improved. Overall great console.Havent tried the new Ps5 yet.
2042,Trevor C,2021,5,I got this console and have been enjoying it a lot since. Works really well on my high refresh rate monitor. I love it.
2043,Stephen,2021,5,Ordering was easy and I was lucky to get it at the time. Only issue was with the box arriving damaged
2044,Dean J Tetz,2021,5,"Overly large packaging but arrived safe and sound. Fits nicely on shelf, easily hooked up. and fast start up."
2045,Yash Srivastava,2020,5,"Such a great console. Great speed, graphics. Game Pass is a game changer, basically Netflix for games for only $1 a month. Couldn’t be happier to play all my multi platform games!"
2046,François-Yves Nadeau,2021,5,"Thx amazon,  was not thinking this will be possible.  You rock"
2047,Marc olivier lalande,2021,3,6months using the controller and already drifting...
2048,Trevor Ouellette,2020,5,Really glad I was able to snag one for myself before the bots got them all. It's an amazing piece of technology and I'm enjoying gaming on it.
2049,Cliente de Amazon,2020,5,Grate product its really the best Xbox since the 360. The Backwards compatibility makes every penny worth it. And what's coming next for the console will be better.
2050,Tommy ,2021,5,"I’ve had the Series X for about a month now and its been working great, the only downside is that its a big console."
2051,Mayo,2021,5,Upgraded from X1X. It's really fast. Just needs more games now.Amazon shipped within a day. Some other vendors may take weeks.
2052,Osato Agbaire,2020,5,"Xbox Series X is a great console! Super fast, a clean minimal look and a ton of games to play, especially the classics. Worth every penny!"
2053,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Bought it for a friend and he loves it! Came sealed so pretty happy about that. So far no issues and everything is alright :)
