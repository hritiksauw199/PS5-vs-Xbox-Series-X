0,AS,2022,1,This was a Christmas gift that arrived with a HUGE dent and would not connect. Horrible! Ruined it for my loved one.
1,Joe Bailey,2022,1,Playstation is charging customers to repair systems that are faulty from the factory. My issue didn't arise until the warranty was expired. (power shutting off during games)
2,Rayson’s Distribution LLC,2022,5,The best value is the digital but this one is the second best haha
3,Viktor K.,2022,5,"I got the PlayStation 5 on Launch Day in November 2020. The quality of the games and their performance has really improved and been maximized! Going into this new generation has really opened my eyes to how gaming can keep improving. I had initially thought that there was no way for game visuals and scope to improve and get better beyond the PS4 generation.When trying out remasters of the last-generation games, you will immediately notice that nearly every game has a 60FPS (Frames Per Second) Mode. When swinging around in Spiderman or brawling in God of War, the performance really makes the games feel fresh and so much better. They not only look better but also feel and move better. It is like you're playing on a Beast-Computer. You will notice that the games are not really making as many compromises in their overall scope and vision.The DualSense Controller has been one of the most innovative factors for me personally. Game controllers have had vibration and haptic feedback rumble before this console, but this new controller really changes the games. You actually feel moments and elements that were originally meant to only be visual through the game. When driving a car in Gran Turismo 7, you feel the weight of the car in the controller. You feel the the road at the bottom half of the controller and whether it is rainy or not will impact that feel. In a Military Action Video Game, you feel each weapon differently and can even feel spinning helicopter blades within the controller moving! A game involving Archery will have a certain expected tension in the triggers like a real-life bow/arrow. The Dualsense controller connects you to the game and really feels next-generation. You have the option to turn off the haptics but it is very cool!Going back to the performance of the new console, it really is super-fast! It comes with an impressive Solid State Drive for storing your games internally and loading a game literally takes one or two seconds. Waiting for a few minutes is a thing of the past! The UI and overall experience really feels new and works fast and great. Some have been skeptical about this next-generation but this is one where not only the visuals of games improve but also their actual realistic feel in your hands.The PlayStation 5 is fun! The Lineup is really amazing and everything looks and plays in a great standard of quality."
4,Aleana Johnson,2022,2,I just got it in today and no one told me that it was going to be used and damaged. I’m a little disappointed.
5,Dorian park,2022,5,I love my ps5 fast shipping and great price
6,Gardenia gonzalez,2022,5,good product
7,Andrew,2022,1,"Do not buy, got the green screen of death in 3 minutes. Didn’t even put it in safe mode… it turned green when I was setting the system up…"
8,Xavier Hall,2022,1,"Playstation HQ told me directly to my face that I should've never bought this console. It's been faulty since the first day. It doesn't work longer than one hour before shutting off. It was sent in to Playstation for repair not even 6 months after owning the console. Nowadays it doesn't run without shutting off. Terrible machine. I wasn't able to get any money back, nevertheless, a refund. Playstation supervisions informed me that they personally never would've bought this, and they feel sorry that I'm an owner, yet they can't do anything to help me. At least they were honest, LOL at me"
9,Wilson F.,2022,5,"Came on time, works great - thank you."
10,Blink,2022,5,you know what time it is
11,Prime Customer,2022,1,Overpriced and doesn't offer much more that ps4. Don't waste your money
12,Alex,2022,5,I got this to play fifa on. I liked it.
13,RPM,2022,1,Why this PlayStation 5 cost 660 😂 what you guys drinking worst part it’s over two year now that Console release lol no thank you
14,Ryan Nasir,2022,1,"I have been a loyal Playstation fan from day 1. I preordered this before release date. I am going through an issue that causes the PS5 to overheat and power itself off mid-game. I sent my PS5 back to Sony 2 times already, and just sent another repair request. They said they will send me a box to return for repair on 08/26/22 and today is 09/28/22, still have not received the box. They do not seem to care about the issue as this would be my 3rd time returning the system. I am extremely unhappy. I work 60 hours a week and with only 1 off day, I do not want to waste my time waiting on the phone for hours to complain. I have a life.  This overheating issue seems to happen when I play a specific game. Whenever I play No Man's Sky for 2+ hours it overheats and powers off. Then the power button does not work. To get the PS5 to work again I have to unplug the power cord and plug it back in. Only then it will power on again. But once this starts happening, it keeps decreasing the time I can keep the PS5 on before it powers off again.  I would try to buy another one, but the PS5 is still not openly available. This is not right!"
15,Shop till you drop,2022,3,"I purchased my PS5 console over a year ago not too long after they came out. First I will say that getting one was not easy at that time, but I was very happy with it when I bought it. I upgraded from a PS4 Pro.  This console is much faster ableit larger and more obvious in the room.  I love playing games on this machine and am an avid gamer.  Since the console only comes with one controller I purchased a second. Well that arrived and didn't work right.  Kept racing up and down the tabs, you could not use it, so back it went. Then I ordered another which worked well at first. But it just recently died, same issue? So I ordered yet another at $74.00. + tax. Guess what same issue when I connected it? So I then returned it and finally got a replacement that works. To me this is just not acceptable quality control on Sony's part given the outlandish  price they are charging for the consoles aa well as the controllers. I think they put too much technical effort into the controllers without making them more sturdy. I don't abuse my equipment, but occasionally the controller will fall to the floor from the arm of my chair etc.  It can't handle being dropped at all.  And clearly given that I have received a number of them with problems, they cannot even handle ruff handling in retail warehouse. To me at nearly $100.00 the controller are the real failure of this system.  Also, I might add that the square button on the latest controller is a bit wonky.  Sometimes I have to press it so hard to get it to engage it makes my fingers hurt.  This makes gaming hard when you are in the middle of a battle etc. So I find myself sometimes going back to my PS4 Pro which is a workhorse and very reliable.  I have four controllers for that and all still work as new.  Sony for the price you are charging make a better product.  The controllers are junk and overpriced. Also they are heavy as hell.  Not what I have come to expect from Sony after years of buying nothing but Sony.  All my video electronics are Sony. I have owned four Sony TV's over the past 30 years.  Not a of them every died or had a problem. I only upgraded to larger sets or flat panels as technology changed.  So to me this console set as a whole falls short of the mark on what I have come to expect from Sony.  Please make or improve your controllers. And offer a better warranty as well. You are charging too much for this kind of issues right out of the box."
16,James Y.,2022,5,"Good system. HARD to Find Disc Bay Version, But Still worth Purchasing"
17,Fredd,2022,5,"The ps5 is great. Fast loading times, great graphics and the controller is awesome . Only downside is internal memory. Would recommend adding more"
18,K. Cross,2022,1,I at least was able to order my Xbox series X from Microsoft as long as I pay for 2 years of game pass
19,Chris Winkler,2022,5,Great console period! Amazing graphics and speed! Almost non-existent lag!! Wonderful system! AAA+++
20,So,2022,5,Thank you for always being there
21,Rich Barnett,2022,5,thats it
22,Kris,2022,3,"I've Had multiple issues with this One, after using for a Good year, Nowit suddenly turns off for no reason, I did Update, CHanged the Extension Wires.and even moved to a different socket . Still Having Issues"
23,Jay Smith,2022,1,"I've owned every single Playstation console and this is by far the biggest piece of junk I've ever owned.  Do not buy!  It took forever to get and when we did, I've had system crashes when I've tried to play games, random bugs with apps, the disk drive sometimes not playing games, controllers not charging and I'm still waiting on new games to come out.I tried to send it back for repair and Sony wants almost $300 to fix this hunk of junk.  More than half the price of the console to fix clearly issues that were overlooked so they could rush it out during the beginning of the pandemic."
24,Solid Snake,2022,5,I finally got it! Lol
25,l,2022,5,the children are like it
26,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Fun to play with
27,PH,2022,5,Was delivered on-time and contained everything as advertised. Package was slightly beat up but not enough to cause damage down into nested boxes; device operates normally so far with no observed issues. Contained a little informational paper on return policy and everything seems professional. Would re-order through this vendor and recommend to others if they can tolerate/afford the price bump/scalping above MSRP.
28,Floyd Crosby,2022,1,OMG. Horrible
29,coachdenz,2022,1,"It quit working! I still have my ps2 since 2000!! and my Ps3, and 4… but this one quits! 500 down the drain!!"
30,Keslen Vialva,2022,1,Right thumb stick is already drifting 🙄Didn’t think it’ll be a big deal but it’s really starting to mess with my gaming experience 😞
31,Alek,2022,5,"If you are debating whether to buy it, just buy it, it's worth it."
32,stephanie,2022,5,pretty good
33,curiousorb,2022,5,So much fun playing sack boy with my family. The graphics are amazing!! So happy to have it!
34,Joshua Epps,2022,5,The game system is by far the better one on the market and thank you Amazon for helping me to acquire one on day one!
35,AleLizama,2022,5,"Best PS console so far, really fast and enjoyable experience. Ratchet and Clank is the most beautiful game ever made yet."
36,Kevin Grajeda,2022,5,It's running my life.
37,James D.,2022,5,"So I didn't buy this PS5 for myself. One of my friends wanted one, so I figured I'd help him out. We tried for months before we able to get it. He still hasn't let me play it.Anyhow, I was at a memorial service for my sister, listening to someone tell a very touching remembrance, when his mom walks up to me and whispers, ""You're killing people with cancer,"" which is not what I was hoping or expecting to hear at the time. She then elaborated, ""Raymond is supposed to be working hard doing cancer research right now,"" (true) ""but instead he's playing video games"" (somewhat true). Although I suppose I am somewhat culpable, I don't really see how that's my problem.I guess this a long way of saying that this console is so good it's minutely delaying musculoskeletal cancer research. I hear the haptics are pretty neat too. Maybe I'll get to play it someday."
38,Henry,2022,5,Will buy it again thanks!
39,wormy,2022,1,where to start lets start with the HDMI cord it came from nintendo !!! the charger cord for the controler came from samsung!!! and they glued a rubber pad on the top half of the controler !!
40,Ubiquitous,2022,1,"Completely overpriced, poorly made and very bad engineering all around. If that’s not reason enough to stay away it’ll already be obsolete before being able to get one for retail price. Save your money — Sony totally failed on this one."
41,Brian,2022,5,"Having now spent a good 300 hours in Elden Ring and having thoroughly tested the console, it is a vast improvement over the other generation consoles. Loading speeds, graphics, design, fluidity of the system interface and the numerous other upgrades coming... Sony is doing big things"
42,H & N,2022,4,"It was pretty good, controller had a little hiccups tho."
43,antoine rivers,2022,5,"The Ps5 is amazing, easily the best console out. Controllers are amazing as well. I see why they’re $69 a piece."
44,Rodney,2022,5,Worth it
45,Laiken,2022,5,"The graphics are dope, elden ring is awesome, everything about it is great! Had it for 8 months now and we enjoy it! No problems at all"
46,BxBoopie,2022,5,My granddaughter loved and tested up when it was delivered to her as a birthday surprise
47,Jason F.,2022,5,"This has been one of the best gifts ever. The graphics, the speed, the controller, the ability to be a full multimedia station is wonderful. Get one and have some fun!"
48,b,2022,5,its better than xbox.
49,FABIAN,2022,5,Best gaming system on the planet! Man I love this thing. Controllers are wayyyy better than ps4. Thank you amazon!!!
50,Gilberto Bolanos Heredia ,2022,5,Gracias Amazon por tenerlos porque en las tiendas están agotados mi nieto esta encantado con el equipo y dice que trabajar excelentemente
51,HODChief,2022,5,By far the superior console over All. Controller also poops on xboxs cheap bs (yes i own a xbx controller for my pc)
52,Amazon Customer,2022,5,Too expensive.
53,Justin Smith,2022,5,I’ve played video games on almost ALL consoles to exist.THIS console right here is THE BEST gaming experience I have EVER had hands down (even better than my gaming PC in my opinion)!!Currently I am gaming on my Xbox Series X and the PS5 is miles better than the Xbox.Buy this if you can get your hands on it!!
54,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"Firstly, Sony did not cause the microchip shortage, the auto industry did. Google it.Lastly, this is just another PlayStation, slightly better hardware than the PS4. Same goes for the latest Xbox. I wasn't going to buy one for several years regardless of the microchip shortage but then I saw there was a matrix unreal engine demo that I could not experience unless I bought one. Having a lot of disposable income, it was worth it to me to buy an Xbox series x In order to play a demo that's not even really a game for about 2 hours and not worth my time to return the Xbox or resell it after so I just kept it.If you have disposable income like that such consoles are worth buying because why not or if you will be really really excited even though the experience is very close to the same thing you're playing now on the same games you're playing now and that's worth purchasing the console, the controllers, even without price gouging tax and everything you're almost at $1,000 out the door... then buy one but be prepared that you might feel a bit let down because it's hardly different than the PS4 same goes for that Xbox."
55,Jonathan Cox,2022,5,I've always enjoyed PlayStation and Nintendo. But man it feels good to have a PS5. Can't wait to get back into Grand Theft Auto Online!
56,Jertez Andrews,2022,5,"Came early then expected Glad I got it, so difficult to just to get one Great System"
57,Tammie E Guilford,2022,5,"As an avid gamer this is AWESOME! The graphics, download time and easy setup is to be commended. PlayStation, you’ve done it again. BUT…..it was VERY pricy"
58,sam young,2022,5,"Great console was able to secure for retail. 4k, 120 fps what else can you ask for? great product."
59,Jose Lozano,2022,5,The shipping was so fast and it came in great condition. Brought it for a gift for my cousin. He enjoys it everyday and never stops playing lol. But definitely a great console!
60,Eliah Samuel,2022,5,Best console ever. Super fast and responsive. When playing it’s really quiet. Overall best one ever
61,Simi Castor,2022,5,So much better and quite compared to my PS4
62,Amazon Customer,2022,5,"The PS5 is something something special. First off, the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers on the new DualSense controllers give us consumers an enhanced experience of our gaming. Next, The load speeds are noticeably faster. I used to scroll through my social media feed while I waited on my game to load up on the PS4, but not anymore. The loading screens take less than 10 seconds to transition smoothly from one setting to another. Lastly, I didn't think graphics could get much better than they already were, but I was proved wrong by Sony. The PS5 features 4K graphics and is crystal clear. All of these new and improved elements definitely maximize the gaming experience of us consumers."
63,Nick,2022,5,better than my ps4
64,Tyler kiesshauer,2022,5,"Short and simple an amazing console, was able to get for msrp and next day delivery, couldn't be happier"
65,Mel & Lars,2022,5,Get it (if you can) & you won’t regret. Enough said.
66,Nick,2022,5,"very nice consoles, graphics are amazing"
67,Max Fleenor,2022,1,Disc drive broke in this console after 30 uses. Sent it in for repair and the repair turnaround time is over 2 months. Save yourself a headache and get the digital version.
68,Du$e Triumphant ,2022,5,Got it on release day. As expected and been happy with it every since
69,Barry,2022,5,Great console with great graphics.
70,Ruth Williams,2022,2,System won't load after 4 months purchased. Working with tech support. But this is unfortunate. Especially for the cost.
71,Chrishenda Dawkins,2022,5,Husband never gets off!!!! So it’s gotta be good right?
72,STEVEN,2022,5,"These are a great value, impressive tech, amazing load times, GREAT controller, easy (but not cheap) to expand memory.Yes, they're hard to find but if you want want, following a PS5 twitter thread should help you land one within a month or so.  Just act quick.Because PC hardware is so marked up, $500 for this seems like a steal for what you get.I recommend getting a controller charger that charges from the bottom prongs of the controllers vs USB c to prevent damage, upgrading storage (M.2 gen 4 5500mb/sec+) and an extra controller because there are several great 2+ player games out."
73,Justin,2022,5,"Couldn’t believe I actually got it, best thing I bought on here"
74,GS,2022,1,25 years of Sony Playstation's and I'm about to go to the dark side.  My kids can't believe I haven't just bought an x box.This is absolutely ridiculous.
75,Lukas,2022,5,Like it very much
76,E&K,2022,4,Love the console.  Fast and love the GUI. Just expected more.
77,Donna,2022,5,Absolutely love the PS5
78,Invisable Ewok,2022,2,"To be perfectly clear. I would normally give this 5 stars... but since you can't get one over a year after launch unless you pay a scalper or reseller twice what it's worth I can't recommend getting one until Sony puts out more units for sale, which is unlikely due to the global chip shortage. And no, you shouldn't have to sign up for special opportunities through major retailers to get a chance at buying one before everyone else. Not a year after launch when early adopters should already have one and the general public should have access to new units. After the supply shortage gets figured out and units are readily available without having to spend twice what they're worth, I'll change my rating.As far as games go, Sony has arguably the best first party lineup currently, with God of War, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima, Gran Turismo, The Last of Us, Uncharted, Demon's Souls, etc. just to name a few. First party games look spectacular, and since it's backwards compatible with PS4, with a lot of major games getting next-gen upgrades you really can't be spoiled enough for choice of games. The console also has a fantastic 4K blu-ray player.The controller is very comfortable, though with some questionable features. I don't like the microphone being built into the controller. Sure it's a decent alternative if you don't want to wear a headset, but too many people in online games forget to mute it, thinking they've muted themselves on their headset and it can get annoying. I'm not a fan of the reactive triggers. Let's say you're playing a game where you use a bow and arrow; the reactive triggers will increase tension in the trigger as you pull the bowstring in-game, so it makes it more difficult to keep the bow drawn for extended periods of time. This can be great for immersion, but personally I just find it makes my fingers sore. Thankfully this can be turned off."
79,Jesse,2021,5,nothing bad
80,Joe Biden,2021,1,I hope every scalper ends up with 20 ps5s collecting dust in their basement
81,Tiffany H.,2021,1,I purchased this in October for Xmas fir my son. It keeps overheating. I bet the seller knew this when they fraudulently sold it to me! I want my money back!
82,Jobin,2021,5,"Great overall console, for streamign and gaming"
83,Noah Y,2021,5,Good and easy to use. needs better games
84,jon,2021,5,Fast and quick load time. love it
85,Art Tep,2021,5,Love it
86,Ryan Francis,2021,5,"can’t believe i was able to snag one of these, i’m in love!"
87,luis Miguel huesca,2021,5,"This console is the real life turboman, make sure you get turboman and not booster."
88,Joseph Pavlik,2021,5,"Fast, quiet, crisp, clean, no caffeine."
89,Kristina Szczech,2021,5,Of course the price was double. But it was my husbands birthday.
90,Alexandre Schutze,2021,5,"I've been playing videogames since Atari, had my Nintendo, Megadrive, SuperNintendo and finally PS1/3/4 Vita and Switch. As soon as I got my hands on my PS5, it just felt that this one would be the best ever.This is a fantastic machine. Navigation feels intuitive, games look sharp and run great. Besides that, DualSense is the most ergonomic controller ever.So far, finished Demon's Souls (beautiful remake) and playing Miles Morales and Guardians of the Galaxy. Playing feels immersive.Also, having access to all my PS4 games is awesome, just sold my old console - this is something I couldn't do when transitioning from PS3 to PS4.The only setbacks are actually getting the console - I admit I was lucky - and the size of it. It's huge, for me it was a burden to carry through airports..."
91,Christopher Patterson,2021,1,"Sony PlayStation, thanks for making sure I never become a PlayStation owner again, or any other game console at that. During the timeframe of limbo where I felt discomfort buying more PS4 games, yet knew the PS5 would soon be within consumer grasp… boy was I wrong."
92,Bryan,2021,5,Lucky to have gotten it
93,Bronson McBride,2021,5,"Once you can finally get your hands on one, you’ll see and enjoy this a whole lot. That controller is the best update I’ve seen in a while. Worth the effort to get it."
94,sdsydnee,2021,3,"Do not but extra controllers from anywhere that won’t give you a full year warranty. My controller began having problems after about a month but didn’t become unusable until about 100 days, a couple weeks after the free 90-day warranty expired."
95,Kateryna,2021,3,"For this money I received a damaged box and was nervous about it, because I bought it for a gift"
96,Average Joe the consumer,2021,5,Purchased as a gift for family member. Over the moon with this.
97,PublicName,2021,1,"This console is deserving of 5 stars but the controller units seem to be so poorly built. The X button has completely stopped working even though every other button functions fully, even after resetting the controller. I never experienced a single issue with a PS4 remote but a ps5 remote within one year."
98,youtee,2021,4,Heck yea!! Awesome system. Controller feedback amazing. 4K ultra blu ray the best.
99,jake,2021,4,Very good console would recommend to anyone looking for a next-gen gaming system. Worth every penny!
100, VaL Cabrera,2021,5,Super happy
101,Javier Antonio,2021,1,No matter what store/online have them there will be nothing only Xbox Series S better buying one of those.eBay have +4000 people selling for $800 to $15000 why?? These people money that badly some having 5 consoles?
102,Allison,2021,5,It has 4K resolution
103,Tobey Cline,2021,5,Can’t go wrong. Now can we??
104,Hasbulla,2021,4,PlayStation has not failed to exceed expectations each new console release. The quickness of this console is crazy. Fast loading speeds. Way quicker than the ps4. Love the layout. Love the look. Just wished they would have more stock. If I did successfully place an order sometimes it would get cancelled and for an invalid reason.
105,Slug Jones,2021,5,"Managed to snag this beast off Amazon randomly during one of the few times they’ve had them. No clue how other than refreshing a lot. I feel bad for those of you who’ve yet to grab one, but while it’s a great console, it’s not *that* amazing. Needs more ps5 exclusive games before I’d worry too much. I still play my PS4 in the bedroom when the boy takes over the living room tv and have a blast. So, don’t let the urge to get your hands on one overwhelm you. You’ll get yours!I do love the console, though. I use it and my series x (again, got super lucky again, but on wally morts website that time) about the same amount.The ps5 is indistinguishable verses the series X in terms of power that I’ve seen. They’re both powerful consoles and outshine my aging 1070ti pc by a ton (that’s been the hardest to upgrade for me).The UI is a fresh look and functional enough. I like the store is just there to select when you feel and it doesn’t have to “load” the store like on ps4 and ps3. I like that it has a pull up *task* bar, for lack of better words, that you can quickly pull up and make on the fly adjustments to the sound control, accounts, etc.The best upgrade are the new controllers, imo. Haptic feedback is a neat feature, though honestly not a deal breaker if games don’t utilize it. It’s cool to feel different guns in games have different trigger feel/pull. My favorite part is the size and shape redesign. Fits my semi larger hands much better, but my 11 year old has no issues, either. It just feels better, if you know what I mean. The one downside I’ve found here is battery life. Absolutely a downgrade verses the PS4 controllers.The ssd is fast and does a good job. The only downside, and it’s kinda big, is the super specific drive you have to buy if you want to upgrade the internal drive. They’re crazy expensive, much like the series X, but more so. Who knows how long we have to wait to see larger than 1TB affordable drives that will work.The console itself is a chonker, so make sure you have the space for ventilation. Not a huge fan of the design, but you can see the design and make your own decision.Good luck on your hunt and keep trying. If you refuse to pay scalpers, as I did, get on Twitter and follow a few of the accounts that alert you to upcoming ps5 stock. That’s how I heard about the Amazon stock when I got this one.Also, screw scalpers. That is all."
106,liwu,2021,5,play game
107,Damian Rodríguez,2021,5,Amazing graphics and gameplay. Love the new setup
108,Edgar R.,2021,5,La consola funciona correctamente.
109,David padilla,2021,5,Great console! Everyone wants one this days!
110,Nolan ,2021,5,The PS4 took ages to load when I’m waiting for a game to download so I can play it but now I can wait less than 4 hours to play and be ready to go the PS4 you have to wait like a day or two for it to finish downloading. Highly recommend it can’t wait for what Sony has for us in the future!!! 10/10
111,Meredith,2021,5,Get your husband one of these and stop faking your nightly headaches!
112,chris951,2021,5,"I was lucky enough to get an invite thru Sony direct in September. The system is great, graphics are awesome and the controller feedback is cool. Not very many games out yet (at least that I'm digging) so don't over pay. Try what I did, get on chat at Sony and talk to rep, make sure that you are able to receive invites. When they send you the survey email express your frustration in comments section at end, but give the rep a good review because it is not their fault and they are trying to help. I did and got a invite 2 days later lol. Be polite people. Good luck and stay off stockx."
113,Steven Rampello,2021,5,Initially I was terrified to buy this because I had read one bad review online and the fact Sony still hasn’t made this readily available is infuriating however my old ps4 was on death’s door and I knew I needed a new one. I have had mine about a month and I use it quite a bit throughout the day. I have had no issues at all so far and have very much enjoyed the product!! Sucks you have to pay like 40% more but that’s Sony’s fault ultimately.The one little issue that didn’t bother me but might bother some of you was the packaging had a tiny tear on the outside upon arrival. When you basically pay 1k for something I could assume you’d expect perfection. But it came fast and I got what I wanted so I am happy!!
114,Jorge Acosta,2021,5,Box came in good condition and has been working for 3 months no issues good gaming console
115,Ronald E Hager,2021,4,The PlayStation 5 Console is great but the controller for the console there was something wrong with I had to buy a other one so my son could play his games on it.
116,Noel davis,2021,5,With all the stealing going on right now happy it made it to my house.
117,lisandro,2021,5,Switching in and out of games is now faster and it’s great to see games running at a smooth 60fps or 120fps if you have at with hdmi 2.1. Great overall product and well worth the upgrade from the PS4
118,Corey Dutter,2021,5,"The controller is the best part about this and beats Xbox out of the water. The Xbox controller still takes batteries, give me a break. Games look great, interface is much improved. 10/10 would recommend."
119,Mamirali,2021,5,Love everything about it .
120,Zapz,2021,4,Finally got the best console 2021
121,Arelis,2021,5,Really happy with the purchase is definitely as described
122,Leo Kotov,2021,5,Awesome gaming system!!! 5 stars
123,Edmond Klein,2021,5,Upgrading PS4 to PS5
124,Thomas Tigertail,2021,5,I really enjoyed this. Glad it wasn’t a scam.
125,Chairna Arnold ,2021,5,My son lives it!
126,TED the VIKING,2021,5,Item was boxed inside a box which was AWESOME & it arrived within 48Hrs of ordering!!
127,Brendan,2021,5,"Got this for my little brother (15) after 7 months of waiting. Refused to pay scalper prices, and patience ended up winning. Got this for MSRP and now him and I both have one and have been playing almost every day together. Very happy with this purchase.Pro tip: those “add to cart links” are the way to go ;)"
128,Simon,2021,3,"Yes, it’s just impossible to buy a PS5, but also any nVidia RTX cards because of the GPU shortage and the scalpers looking to make a quick buck. Actually I’ve seen manufacturers adding a fan or two and selling the same card with 70% more profit! This uncharted territory can only be solved by Sony and other manufacturers releasing new products every other year. People judge Apple for incremental updates, but that model has worked very well. It would be less likely to see any shortage one year into the release if another one is coming, because it would be less entertaining for scalpers to invest their money on items that are going to be obsolete soon. Just food for thought for the future."
129,HolyMoly,2021,5,Expectations met
130,Desiree stanley ,2021,1,"Paid over 1,000$ for a scam a machine that doesn’t work…"
131,Tracy,2021,5,Got my order on the date that it said and wild and has worked great.
132,John Sullenberger,2021,5,
133,Robert,2021,5,The console is amazing and I’m still amazed by the load times and what really still stands out to me is how well designed the controller is and how reactive it is. The changes that they made really makes playing the same games feel so different!
134,C. Kidd,2021,5,Husband loves it. Has best graphics and speed ever
135,benjamin johnston,2021,5,Was lucky to get it and love the hell out of it
136,Jay,2021,1,Can’t play any game for longer than 2 minutes without it crashing. Literally no game will play. DO NOT BUY.
137,Bryant,2021,4,"Arrived well packaged and put-together. Distributors are spiking the selling price to combat scalping, which had me worried about the integrity of the product.Luckily my worries were unfounded. Package arrived as advertised and has run smoothly ever since.4.5/5"
138,CJ,2021,5,I upgraded from a PS3 to the PS5 and wow what a difference. It’s an excellent console that is fast and fun with many of app options.  I also have an Xbox One and the PS5 is a fantastic upgrade from that console.
139,Tim m.,2021,1,"Long time ps fan, but this one is so messed up.  You don't have enough stock then hold the release date until u do.  I see so many people getting ripped off n it's sonys fault.  I just bought a pc, so buy Sony you lost a fan."
140,Juan,2021,5,Immensely invaluable quality! Fast delivery. Exceptional packaging. Seller is fab and distinguished.
141,James Tagliavia,2021,5,Fast shipping arrived earlier than was projected. Love the graphics and load time. My favorite is being able to switch between my games and my HBOmax or Netflix which comes in handy using wireless headphones while the family is asleep.
142,Jason Wong,2021,4,"PS5 is overhyped and it runs super hot. Console device was larger than i expect, but overall performance is amazing so 4 stars."
143,luis castro,2021,5,Never thought I’d be able to get one but I finally did somehow. So glad I did. Love this thing and so does my girlfriend. Great console and can’t wait to see what Sony does next
144,Julius,2021,5,Buy it or shut tf up
145,J. Conrad,2021,5,"The PlayStation 5 is excellent. Glad I finally got the opportunity to get one. I’m not a fan boy, I prefer to own all of the current systems. But this one is the Capstone!"
146,Purchaser,2021,5,I followed a live stream on twitch to get this ps5 once amazon stocked it. Love it! Great buy and upgrade.
147,Christine,2021,5,"I am extremely happy with my PS5. Yes, I did pay a bit more for it than the original price, but to me it was well worth it. It came within a week or ordering it and it was in new, perfect condition. Easy to set up and it works flawlessly. I worked with Customer Service for a small shipping concern, but they were super friendly and helped me out immediately. Extremely satisfied with this purchase."
148,Dr. Fishopolis,2021,5,"If you can get your hands on this, it is 100% worth the price.The controller is awesome and it always surprises me how each dualshock generation blows away the last gen. The haptic feedback on the triggers is worth the hype, I just hope they will release more games that utilize this tech in the future.But really, backwards compatibility is why I bought this. I typically only buy a console after it's been out a few years because of the small game selection at launch and I'm not willing to pay $70 for a new game. Those criticisms are out the window this gen because my entire ps4 library is now my ps5 library. Even better, some games have had free ps5 upgrades (No Man's Sky) that really boost the graphics and add haptic feedback support. And games without a ps5 upgrade will generally run at a solid 60fps and have lightning fast load times.Do what I did, buy this and sell your old ps4 to help pay for it. I sold my ps4 pro for $300, so this console upgrade only really cost me $200. For 200 bucks, this is a no brainer (if, and this is a big IF, you can find it at MSRP)."
149,David P.,2021,5,Great graphics. Fast game play
150,Lee Roy Brown,2021,5,If you can get one at Msrp totally buy a ps5. It’s a crazy good value. I would not pay more than msrp for one.
151,TF,2021,1,"I bought the product for my sons birthday. He used it literally 2 times. I contacted the seller and they said that 30 days had passed already on this over priced used item. We had this thing 38 days guys.  This was the most expensive 2 time use of a product that I have ever seen. It’s not like the product had the $499.00 price tag it had when it first came out. They charged over over $ 1000.00 for this PlayStation 5 and they couldn’t even make it right. I could see if a couple of months had gone by and I asked for help after that long but it was 38 days. They swear it was brand new but it wasn’t. They wouldn’t even offer an exchange or anything. We finally got one from a legitimate retailer and believe me it’s still working right and we are so happy and excited. We even tried to get it fixed and the place we took it to said the  motor was burnt out and that the problem was  definitely internal. They said this shouldn’t have happened if it was brand new like this seller said. Please keep your money. Don’t buy from this seller. If they even tried to offer a refund or exchange I would’ve acknowledged that they at least tried to help us out. The holidays are coming and some of these sellers will be trying to push off old refurbished products  and old used items. It’s up to us to call them out on it especially if they claim what they are selling is brand new. It’s up to us to let others know in an in depth review about things that aren’t right! DON’T FALL FOR IT! Go to the more legitimate retailers. In this case I didn’t even pay for the new one what I paid for this one. I told the new retailer I went to what happened and they actually gave me a discount. The one we got was a real legitimate brand new Play Station 5 with a warranty of 2 years yes 2 years is what they gave me, they also knocked some off of the price they were selling it for in the store. So in some ways we still came out on top but I wanted to let somebody know who might stumble across this seller and think you might be getting a legitimate deal. YOU’RE NOT! Some sellers just take more pride in making their customers happy this one DID’NT. I have never even heard of this seller but I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt . I am not writing this review to be bitter. I’m writing it because it’s the Truth!  They didn’t hesitate to brush me off. I wanted anyone who was thinking about buying from them to think long and hard about it. We even tried to call Sony because this seller said well  call the manufacturer that’s basically all we can tell you to do. We tried Sony and they said well you can ship it to us but it will probably be after the holidays  or maybe longer into the next year before we can even look at it. Please don’t try and delete my review. People need to know about these products you guys are trying to push off on unsuspecting buyers!"
152,WayneW89,2021,5,I've been waiting on this for a long time and after playing the past 3 months it been smooth. The haptic feedback make playing certain games more enjoyable and if your into graphics and the sort. With the right TV settings you can't go wrong with games with great graphics. Only down side is the base storage to me. And being a little more portable being that I travel alot.
153,Kindle Customer,2021,4,"It claimed to come with the console stand. It didn't. Fast shipping, happy with my order so 1 star deducted."
154,Robert,2021,5,Bought is a birthday gift and person was super happy
155,Tom Racey,2021,4,Everything was great except the controller. Left stick pulled to the left sometimes and would stick making the camera in the games spin
156,Isiah D. Martin Jr,2021,5,Like it because my/our grandson requested this item specifically for Xmas.
157,Anselmo Blyden,2021,4,"I got my PS5 & was so excited & ready to play on it but unfortunately the disc drive doesn't work. So, I have to ship it back to Sony for repairs."
158,Askia Lewis,2021,5,like. Amazon stock was actual a real stock. prevent the bots
159,Yadiel,2021,5,I need to rate it 10×
160,tarsh can,2021,1,tarsh
161,Josue M.,2021,5,Came on time and everything
162,Eric G.,2021,5,Got lucky and got one at regular store price on Amazon. Runs great it's fast at loading games and makes everything look smoother as far a graphics go.
163,Gabby,2021,5,A lot of people are complaining about the price but you need to be realistic about the current state of the world.1. There are shortages on microchips and various other products making demand for certain technology aka the PS5 extremely high.2. Demand is through the roof in general for this product driving the price up even more and making them 10xs harder to find (especially real ones).3. Inflation. Everything is going up in price!All of this combined made me extremely glad I bought this system when I did even at the price I did! It came exactly as described and faster than the expected delivery date! If you’re looking to save some money get the cheapest shipping and have patience!
164,Dawn,2021,5,"Fast shipping, packed well. Great item"
165,Germain Krauss,2021,1,My PS5 came opened and resealed with packing tape?! I don’t want to open it! The box is also very damaged and retaped all over.
166,Amazon Customer,2021,1,"If something is listed as new, it should probably be new. I was sent a damaged, used Ps5 that smelled of cigarette smoke."
167,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Best video game console
168,Arya Bakhti,2021,5,"The PlayStation 5 is a powerful and well-designed console that delivers an exciting next-generation gaming experience. Its exclusive game catalog continues to be a showcase for the PS5's fantastic DualSense controller, spatial 3D audio technology, and super-fast SSD, and it's why so many gamers will be lusting after Sony's latest platform. However, it may be too large for some installations, and a handful of flaws keep it from being a five-star product. It is, however, a welcome upgrade over the PS4 and a thrilling gateway to next-gen gaming."
169,bdt ,2021,5,Very hard to get. Once you get it you’ll be extremely satisfied.
170,User2000,2021,1,System Broker after a little more than a week or so returned it as soon as possible would not turn on or eject my disk so I requested a refund was told to return it before the 9th of October and I shipped it before and have still yet to receive it despite it being delivered back. Don’t waste your money or time I got played
171,pablo hernandez,2021,5,Me ágrafo
172,Sweet Pea,2021,5,I used this product for my lady cave. The system is just beautiful!
173,s,2021,5,"I love this PS5 Console, that is working fine with me."
174,shengjie,2021,5,A great console
175,Omnipsyte,2021,3,As title states...
176,YO,2021,1,Couldn't cop a Soulja Boy Console so I had to settle for a PS5 :(
177,Joe Carrier,2021,5,I expect in a few months my grandson will being playing this new PS5 game system and will be very happy
178,Travis Boatman,2021,5,That only took 11 months but I got one and I love it. Looks great visually on the tv pored to a Sony 4k tv. The unit is huge. Only thing I did was up grade to a highend HDMI cable
179,ronnell macklin,2021,4,"I disliked the price of the console that I had to pay, for now the console runs good. I have some issues with some stuttering in my game play from time to time on black ops Cold War so I am not sure if it’s the console or the game. The picture quality was off the charts at first until I hand bring it down for my games reaction time to improve !!"
180,Patti Mallette,2021,5,Definitely a fast and easy to learn.
181,Elvin Rosendo,2021,5,Me encanta son los mejores los amo
182,John Boyd,2021,5,My PS5 arrived quickly under the predicted shipping time and in perfect condition. Would definitely order from them again.
183,Edwin Soto Santiago,2021,5,Good Product
184,Tha Dude,2021,3,"The PS5 was not new, unfortunately, the box had been opened previously. The packing was not very good. But non the less my son now has a PS5."
185,Perry Ketter Jr,2021,5,Even though it's like playing the Playstation 4. But the graphics are impressive.
186,Jerome B.,2021,4,"The system came three days late, but when I received it it was worth the money, I only played Spyder-man on it so far since the covid slow down production on everything, but every much worth the buy."
187,"Autumn Smith, Kindle Customer",2021,5,"Okay so first off Ravenholm Electronics has recieved some really bad reviews, but I figured I would give them a chance! I spent about 500 less than I would have with a new PS5, and it was worth it. Right off the bat I could tell this PS5 had been used, a few scratches, but it still looked pretty new. It works, and is fully functionally, I'm an electrician so I knew what to look for, and everything looks good. I fully recommend giving Ravenholm Electronics a chance. I've been trying to get a PS5 for a year and they supplied me one and I'm very happy with the product!!!"
188,Brian,2021,1,Appears to have been used and opened before not new as claimed the seal was pulled open before and was dirty. Sold as new when clearly used
189,Jesus,2021,5,I love it and it real at first I was like ouuu idk but I love it the the real deal I got no problem with it
190,Antwain love,2021,5,
191,crystal lee cotton,2021,5,My son loves it.
192,Angel,2021,5,We love it! Everything is great!
193,Arthur J.,2021,5,You find a lot of the ps5 reviews to be low because people complain about not being able to get one but I have it and it’s a good product PS did it again
194,Ryan C. Fishback,2021,5,"Once you can actually get one, it's a great console. The backwards compatibility is definitely a selling point especially when you purchase early on in a new consoles life. Don't pay scalper prices though. Be patient and wait for your chance to buy one at normal retail."
195,kenneth snyder,2021,5,They are definitely selling real working ps5’s mine was brand new.
196,Amazon Customer,2021,1,"The packaging the ps5 came with was essentially just a box inside a box, they used plastic airbags filled with air to keep the package….”safe” during shipping. Upon receiving my package, all of these airbags had popped leaving absolutely nothing to prevent the system from damage. The disc drive for some reason, is EXTREMELY loud. It literally sounds like im sitting next to an industrial air conditioner. My ps5, also cannot multitask at all. I cannot actively do two things or have two applications running at once, or else my ping will spike viciously despite the fact that i have great wifi with even better bandwidth. Also…800$?!?!!? Absolutely ridiculous save your money for a mid-tier gaming pc folks."
197,Dante G.,2021,4,For the most part. The PlayStation 5 hasn’t disappointed yet.
198,Jennifer Roma,2021,5,good conse
199,Sean Ferguson,2021,4,"The PS5 arrived quickly and in good condition, but like all non-retail sellers has/had the system significantly over priced."
200,Aziz,2021,5,👍
201,Marvin Bugarin,2021,5,Love the ps5 great product would recommend to anyone looking for a new gaming device.
202,al,2021,4,Expensive
203,Alejandro Valdes,2021,5,Producto en perfectas condiciones como se puso en la descripción satisfecho con la compra
204,Katia Cristina de Oliveria Fialho,2021,5,Perfect
205,brandon stewart,2021,4,"The order arrived on the day as specified at checkout. Everything works great. The PS5 is amazing and far superior to the PS4. Sure I paid more than I would at a retail store, but I wanted it now and who knows when the stores will have a shipment come in. I ignored the negative reviews about the price. It is simple supply and demand. I wanted it bad enough, so I paid a few hundred dollars more. If the price is an issue for you, I  suggest that you don't pay it and skip posting a review."
206,daniel rodriguez,2021,5,The PlayStation 5 is awesome but too expensive but at the end I am happy with my PlayStation 5
207,Khyla Moore,2021,5,I thought it would be a scam you know since there are little ps5 in the country but i was so excited when i plugged it up and it was real.
208,Jaliyah Smith,2021,5,Brand new and it came a day early. Over priced but worth it.
209,Mario Gallego,2021,5,My PS5 came a few days earlier than expected so that was a pleasant surprise. Everything was there that should be there. PlayStation works great so far. Very happy with my purchase from this seller. Would buy from this seller again
210,Temora Calloway-Jones,2021,5,He's VERY happy
211,richard oh,2021,5,"Sony put alot of planning into this console. By 2023/2024 we are going to see games from this console that will blow your mind away. If you're having problems getting this console, by June/July 2022 you will be able to buy the Ps5 in store. Good luck to all you gamers!"
212,Ryan C,2021,5,Love it!
213,Jeri Keegan,2021,5,Huge Playstation Fan! I highly recommend this!
214,Amazon Customer,2021,5,I was so excited that we found this! It is exactly what was expected !
215,Orlando T.,2021,5,"First, i was worried about the delivery would be damaged.  Its all good and my ps5 runs perfect!!"
216,Nidah Nafees,2021,5,"From the aesthetics the console is 10/10, the controller design is a 10/10, graphics is a 10/10. There is nothing bad to say about the console…it’s a PS5!! Lol"
217,Win_Easy,2021,5,"I was a little sketched out ordering such a hard to obtain product from a 3rd party seller on Amazon, but after two shipping delays (fault of UPS) and still receiving  it 3 days earlier than expected, I just want to say that if ordered from the supplier I got mine from, you should expect to receive your ps5 in a timely manner and it's a real ps5.Say what you want about the price gouging. I think it's pretty ridiculous as well. But if you have the money to spend and you want a next Gen amazing game system, the just do it! It's well worth it people. I've been playing mine for like 8 hours straight, the game install times are insanely fast, the load times are insanely fast, the graphics are by far the best I've ever seen on a console, and even though I set mine to the visual mode vs the 120hz mode, it still seems like it's defaulting to 120hz while maintaining the higher graphics settings? Not sure why it's doing that but I'm not complaining!"
218,Vikash,2021,3,Very good and came in mint condition But they made me pay $260 import fee just to get the damn box
219,Jackie & Christina Mitchell,2021,5,"I know that I paid more than I should have for this, but it wasn't a scam and I was able to surprise my husband. Great shipping and honest seller."
220,Amazon Customer,2021,4,"Performs the way you think it would. Definitely didn’t like paying almost $1,000, but I think it’s worth it for the die-hard PlayStation fans."
221,john goldson,2021,5,"The PS5 doesn't have issues. Very reliable,  shipped fast , ."
222,D. Burton,2021,5,I’ve been trying to get a PS5 for months and all of a sudden I got a notification from the Treasure  Truck that there they had some PS5’s! The transfer of my games from my PS4 to my PS5 via ethernet cable was fast and efficient. And the fact that I can play every single one of my PS4 games on the new PS5 is a huge bonus. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase!
223,Jessie,2021,5,Too lazy to take a picture but it’s real. Works great. A little costly but the graphics are amazing. Wish there was a better selection of games out but 2022 looks hopeful. Now excuse me as I play Tales of Arise
224,Diamond Soden,2021,5,"I love it, shipping was the fastest ever, product came in mint condition!"
225,chi duong,2021,5,"Great system, amazing graphics!"
226,Daniel G. King,2021,4,Bought my PS5 from a reseller and it arrived on time. Opened the box and found that the packaging was damaged and the box the console came in had clearly been opened. Wrote the seller and was assured that the console was new. On close examination it does appear to be unused and setup appeared to be from factory settings. Still have my suspicions but am satisfied with the purchase for now.
227,Nanny,2021,3,It arrived well packaged. It looks good. It’s a Christmas gift so I won’t know how well it performs until then.  The star rating could change in December. Hopefully in a positive direction.
228,Family man,2021,5,"Product was as described,arrived on time"
229,Jorge A. Hernandez,2021,1,"El control nunca predio vino dañado , no lo cambiaron . No recomiendo este suplidor"
230,Lindsay Bryant,2021,5,Great and thank you
231,Rick,2021,5,Quite literally the best thing I could ever spend $600 on get more than my money's worth. I just wish there was enough to go around.
232,David Hunter,2021,5,Just like advertised.
233,bryan gotelip,2021,5,This console is fantastic and the exclusives out so far are all bangers! Id you’re on the fence on getting a Series X or a Ps5 this is the one to go for. I have both consoles and i have no motivation to touch my Xbox. I always come back to play the Ps5 due to its controller. The controller really does add to the immersion. So in the end this console is a must get for this new generation!
234,Keegan Thomas Spillane,2021,5,"Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Obviously overpaid for it, but that was my decision."
235,Mary Franklin,2021,5,I use this for entertainment. The kids love it.
236,RR,2021,5,"Purchased through Amazon’s treasure truck! 😁 literally began giggling like when I was 5 years old and just got a PlayStation 1 (yes, I remember that day as well).Works flawlessly after 2 months and constant abusive use. Controllers feel great and I think overall was a good upgrade by Sony. The console itself is bulky but not an eyesore, atleast not with my setup. Overall highly recommend."
237,Colleen,2021,5,"Such a great console, glad to finally have one!"
238,Vini,2021,5,"I am so lucky to buy one. My son likes it so much. It comes with very good package with protection. The games are so attractive that I could spend lots of time on it with my son. The initial setup is very simple, and the interface of PS5 should be very easy to navigate, you can quickly find where the games are located. The UI interface of PS5 looks like PS4's in some where, but it is indeed different, and many places are obviously more elegant. Anyways, we all have a good time with it these time. Good to have it in the family!"
239,Christian Y.,2021,5,Everything about this from the sleek design to the streamlined UI is just beautifully executed. Runs all my games from previous generations. Load times are cut to a fraction of the time. Graphics leave nothing to be desired. It’s just a phenomenal system.
240,Gary Bates,2021,5,It was new. But it did cost me $1000.
241,Skyboy71,2021,5,"Fast and as advertised, I was a bit worried but it showed up"
242,Rafael Andara,2021,5,Good Product
243,Marco,2021,5,Everything was perfect from delivery to gaming experience got it early than expect it
244,Alex613664,2021,5,I am super satisfied with this Machinery. The 4k on this is true to its name. The 60 frames are super smooth. Only thing I recommend is upgrading to a TV that supports 120hz so you can get that true Next Generation feel to your picture. I still need to upgrade my 4k to an 8k. Happy :)
245,Basil Foxx,2021,1,does not work properly
246,jcrangel81,2021,5,"It does everything, plus it's backwards compatible."
247,jamie d lee,2021,2,The ps5 controller is so nice compared to the ps4. However this console is so expensive! I am unsure what it does better than the ps4 other than a BIT faster...
248,Daniel Marrazzo,2021,5,"We love our PS5.  We love it so much we bought two.  Now, we have one for sale."
249,Jaydan Figley,2021,3,It works good and is a lot of fun but I still thinks it’s dumb ow they are price gouging it this bad
250,Tish,2021,5,No complaint for my first big purchase and my PS5 works just fine thanks!
251,Leonardo Gedler,2021,5,This is an amazing console. I bought it with Demon's Souls and I'm enjoying it at max.The package arrived as expected and in perfect conditions.
252,Quinton Smith,2021,5,Bear console out there!
253,Cristian Garrett-Trejos,2021,5,The box came a little beat up and when I opened the bow the playstation sleeve was very beat up but the play station itself works amazingly and everything was in perfect condition!
254,Salah N Abdallah,2021,5,I’ve always been an Xbox guy but I tried PlayStation for the first time and I don’t have any regrets best choice yet
255,Daniel,2021,5,Best thing since sliced bread!
256,alan,2021,4,I got this PS5 for my grand kids the hardest way to get anything is trying to compete with the  Slow Amazon Internet when I have high speed Internet
257,Muhammad Maaz Nasir,2021,5,This is the best console in the market
258,victor jamison maciel,2021,5,My family really enjoys it!!
259,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Nothing like a PS5
260,David Tramble,2021,5,Finally was able to get one at regular price!
261,Tyler Brown,2021,5,Love it. Perfect for gaming.
262,R. Alexander,2021,5,Thank you amazon
263,abner,2021,5,Que el precio es un poco alto pero si lo quieres ya sabes
264,McBrizzle,2021,5,"The box took a beating, but the console works fine. Zero damage...Ordered on a Thursday night, received it Saturday afternoon. Yes it's overpriced...Yes the seller is legit...Yes I'm glad I bought it."
265,May Ames,2021,5,"Finally, I’m able to enjoy the amazing PS5."
266,Eloy V,2021,2,"The console was shipped fast which is great, but it seems whether deliberately or accidentally, they didn't care. Upon opening the box, I noticed the PS5's box was ripped and the bottom flaps loose as if it were opened. The only protection was one single sheet of paper. Nicely done 👍"
267,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"No damage to the console, very well packaged and it was everything we were hoping it would be"
268,EJ,2021,5,
269,Monique,2021,5,I found this on Amazon and bought it right away! It was even delivered a day early in a nondescript box. Thank you! Happy early Christmas for my family!
270,Darien,2021,5,"I was able to secure one when they did a drop a few days ago(9/21/21) and it arrived two days later. I've always been a PlayStation fan dating back to the original ps1 and I've owned every PlayStation console since then. Me getting a PS5 was a no brainer especially when it comes to the array of titles that the console has. Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Demon's Souls, Ghost of Tsushima(w/PS5 upgrade), Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal and many more. I'm looking forward to all this generation of PlayStation has to offer and I'm glad that I'm able to be apart of the action."
271,Eric H,2021,5,"What is there to say, it's the next gen PlayStation console. I've had every PlayStation since the PS2. I love the controller, and I love that it's backwards compatible. Plus, I didn't pay a scalper."
272,John P. Marden,2021,5,Great console
273,Jeramey Erdman,2021,5,"I am so thankful to have finally got one. Thank you amazon for this, I have waited to long and I suggest everyone else try to buy asap before holiday prices skyrocket!!"
274,Marco A Morales,2021,5,"Wasnt even looking for one and one day i get a trasure truck notification that they had one, less then a min passed before i pressed buy now, tried a 2nd time and was sold out. Now that i have it im happy with it."
275,Daphne,2021,4,It's really nice and it was new
276,Demonking1026,2021,5,Using as intended
277,AmazonAddict,2021,5,"I know it was slim to none in getting a PS5 when I signed up to multiple retailers for updates on PS5 availability. I tried everything to buy a PS5 but I could NOT beat the bots that snatched up the inventory in a second. I get it, nearly everyone likes to make money. So, knowing it may take 2-3 more years before the “chip shortage” would catch up to demand I didn’t mind to spend a little more to get a PS5. The system is fast and it was easy to transfer your old PS4 onto a PS5."
278,Corey bryan,2021,4,"I caved and paid almost double MSRP so I could surprise my brother with a PS5, the box was in such awful shape I couldn't give it to him as it was, so I had to secretly set it up for him. Everything came with it and no issues with the console or controller thus far, but for the very first thing you see looking like it spent time in a garbage disposal, I was very concerned if the console would even work."
279,C.L. Ramirez,2021,5,"I was one of the lucky ones to be in the right place at the right time.PS5 is a great machine with smooth graphics, fast seek times, and great quality.I wish many could enjoy it, but until AMAZON negates vendors to post the console at doubled, tripled, or quadrupled the price; the problem with finding this machine will persist.They need to get a handle on BOTS and Scalpers. What's the point of being a loyal customer with prime membership since AMAZON inception if you are left wanting a product that is taken by algorithms and shady business practices.buy the PS5 at a normal price and do not give in to the scalpers.  games are great but SONY hasn't released a CONSOLE MOVING game yet so do not rush it."
280,Albert Lara Bernabe,2021,5,Is crazy to buy one PS5 but I won
281,ivan,2021,1,No purchase limit. Scalpers won
282,Dan,2021,1,complete garbage
283,Haliyah,2021,1,SAID IN STOCK FOR 499 WOULD NOT ALLOW YOU TO ADD THE GAME TO YOUR CART BUT WILL CONSTANTLY TRY TO GET YOU TO BUY IT FOR 1000!!! STOP WASTING PEOPLES TIME AND EFFORT!! I AM TRYING TO BUY ONE FOR A BDAY GIFT AND THIS IS SO STUPID!
284,Nipples Malone,2021,1,"Amazon just dropped a new batch of PS5s today and surprise surprise within seconds, they were all gone! This is ridiculous, either there are thousands of people like me sitting at their computers trying to get one, which isn’t hard to believe, or there’s a bunch of losers using bots to buy up all the PS five. This sucks, it’s almost been a year and I’ve been trying to get one for a long time."
285,Amazon Customer,2021,5,I love the console and everything playstation they have done so far but the amount of people review bombing this is just stupid if your mad you can't buy one don't leave a review there is a chip shortage and it affects way more than your console your crying about.
286,delta4,2021,5,This system was packed and shipped safely. Came earlier than anticipated. Purchased for my son and he is thrilled. 100%  It was expensive but worth it for the kid.
287,Dr P,2021,5,"Great graphics, excellent exclusive games."
288,Gingka Hagane,2021,1,Thanks Thanos.
289,Kain Torres,2021,1,Garbage
290,Mr. Answer seeker,2021,1,"Don't see what the big deal is. I guess everyone want to be on the high horse bragging about being one of the first people to have one. Sony, Jordan's, and Apple got people going broke just to have it."
291,Randy,2021,5,Absolutely do not regret ordering this PS5 at all.Fast delivery and in perfect running order. Very satisfied!
292,How,2021,5,It’s great! Exactly what I wanted
293,Adam Kreisler,2021,4,I like the product was packed well and was described as seller I didn’t like the poor delivery service I got and made arrangements for someone to be home and no notification by seller ups nothing it was very frustrating but overall very happy with the product and the seller did make up for the inconvenience at the end and very happy with the product so I will give him a 4 out of five overall
294,James,2021,4,I was relieved when the PS5 arrived and when it turned on. What I bought is exactly what I got.The price sucked...
295,Ernest,2021,5,Good Product
296,Art,2021,5,Big props to Amazon for the Amazon Treasure Truck. Received a text message from the Treasure Truck and I was lucky enough to get a PS5. Absolutely amazing. Thank you Amazon!!!
297,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Another treasure truck dealeo
298,Steven,2021,5,Came exactly as advertised and showed up a day early
299,Destiny,2021,5,Got my PS5 a day early and it’s amazing works perfect
300,J. S.,2021,5,Everything was perfect
301,Jose angeles,2021,5,I love everything about it
302,Anna Rebhan,2021,5,"This is for my son, its a surprise"
303,Dillon hill,2021,5,Price I high but happy with it
304,Philip Fernandes,2021,5,Arrived on time and as described. Brand new and works great 👍
305,James E,2021,1,Box was damaged and clearly opened from the bottom and re-taped.  I cannot believe this PS5 was sent out as a new product.
306,Tonya Morgan,2021,5,"Bought a PS5 Disk Console. Arrived on time, shipping box was a little beat up but, ps5 box was packed well. Box was still factory sealed and works great. Paying over retail price was hard but, happy with service and product."
307,Anthony,2021,5,"Purchased a PS5 on day 1 release for $500 at target love it! & I ended up purchasing this from the seller even tho it cost more I had a $300 discount on my account & paid the remaining balance for my bestfriend & she send me the $ because she wanted a PS5 so bad, was skeptical but when it came it, it was brand new beautiful just like mine from target! Good purchase!"
308,broderic kartholl,2021,5,So the PS5 is worth it because of Spiderman/Steep/Riders Republic. 60FPS with reasonable graphics is my cup of tea. I enjoy physic games like Steep/Riders Republic. Spiderman 3 PC/Spiderman: No Way Home motivated me to get the PS5. I enjoyed the PS1 Spiderman games also.
309,R.L,2021,5,Funny how when you get it & play it all day all night for like a month or two & the hype is now gone 😆 it’s a quite a device I must say now I get to play it like may be once or twice a month 😮
310,Cyoung,2021,5,Love it!!!
311,Marko,2021,5,The PS5 works like a charm with no imperfections. The box was a little bit ripped on the edges but trust me you ain't gonna find a PS5 box that looks untouched LOL I'm glad I overpaid this because I have no patience to camp outside of BestBuy!
312,Mr.WildCal,2021,5,Love my PS5. The graphics and every thing about this console is amazing. I really enjoy the look and feel of the controllers! Also this first gen will be the best I think!
313,Coder,2021,5,"So happy with the purchase, fast delivery and an awesome console!Waited quite awhile to get one retail priced.Not many games out there yet, but so far existing PS4 games look fantastic on it"
314,Kassalyn Whiting,2021,1,Brand new does not power on
315,John E,2021,5,"The title sums up my review.  Others have written excellent reviews about the PS5's performance, so I defer to them. I am enjoying  my disk version of the PS5."
316,Curtis Mckinney,2021,5,"Said I wouldn’t get one, but then I got one!"
317,Chris Bailey,2021,5,Love the new graphics look so real: what I dislike is the storage.
318,Kramer Drummer,2021,4,"The only reason it doesn't get the 5th star is because Sony decided to REMOVE the function that copies all your saved game progress files to an external USB drive. They now only allow you to copy to their cloud, and in order to do that you need to PAY a subscription to play station plus. It is a ridiculous and greedy move. Hopefully they will restore this function during a future update."
319,Daniel Chee,2021,3,"Box came damaged. A pity but this is again, a very sought after item. Can’t even ask for one in exchange! Lol"
320,ian,2021,1,Title says it all!!!!!
321,David,2021,5,Love PS5. Way better than XBX. Greatest console ever.
322,Abraham Hartsock,2021,5,I have been trying to get this forever! thank you amazon
323,Lucas Liebman,2021,5,Great console
324,todd woodley,2021,5,Product arrived on time.
325,J. Steele,2021,5,"It's unfortunate these consoles are being sold at above MSRP, but the price wasn't as bad as most I've seen. The package arrived as scheduled and I'm happy with my purchase."
326,Robert W.,2021,5,Product came fast and great condition
327,Heather Beardsley,2021,5,Came just as described
328,Semir D,2021,1,I don’t know if my was new or used to me it looks like used and sold for 1180$ something $$$ i m gonna need new one for this money ok
329,Hall's,2021,5,"It was a gift to my boyfriend. He was so surprised since they were out of stock everywhere. Thanks to amazon, it’s safe to say i’m the best girlfriend ever!"
330,Howard S.,2021,5,System was delivered fast as expected. Great condition no damage and ready to go.
331,Brenna K. Egan,2021,5,Glad to finally have it!
332,Jude,2021,5,Good console
333,Sandhya,2021,5,Loving my new ps5 so far. It's incredibly fast. It shipped to me in NYC from California and only took 7 days from when I placed the order.
334,jian hng,2021,3,I spent a lot of time waiting of it to restock. For gaming it is the best gaming console.
335,chickenice,2021,4,"Overall the consol looks great, and everyone love it. It is also convenient I bring this to my friends house and play with them. The price is not expensive comparing buying a GPU to play some 3A games."
336,Gregg,2021,5,"The console is huge but I lay mine horizontal to fit in my entertainment center. The controller is innovative and the best part of the new console.  If you can find one, buy it and ENJOY!"
337,Erik C.,2021,5,"I have been PC gaming since 2011. I haven't owned a console since 2004 and the first Xbox was out. I decided to get a PS5 because there was so many awesome exclusives! even though a lot of the PS exclusives are making their way to PC recently. I feel its specially worth if you never owned a PS4 or played any of the PS4 games before like me. The Built in SSD is super fast! Really like it.NOTE: I recommend getting the Disc over Digital any given day because Games are pretty Big. Some are 90GB and you run out of space pretty fast! even on the Disc Version. Overall, very happy!"
338,Terry,2021,4,I like the Ps5
339,Ray,2021,5,Finally got it
340,aaron giesin,2021,5,It's what I paid for...tada!
341,derek pinard,2021,5,Came earlier then expected. Everything was good.
342,Nelson E. Oles,2021,5,It booted up and is able to play Sony PlayStation 5 games. It's a PlayStation5. It's doing just what it's supposed to do.
343,Naim Musa,2021,5,Perfect conditions
344,MichStangGuy,2021,5,Brand new PS5 unopened with anti-tampering stickers still in place on box. 5 star!
345,Kristen,2021,5,What an absolute amazing innovation. Initial thoughts on the disc-based PS5 after a couple of days use. The console is by turns gigantic and Cupertino-designed spaceship sleek compared to previous generations. A far cry from the Atari VCS where my video game odyssey began with a cousin's unwanted Christmas gift in 1980. My eight-year-old self would have jumped at the chance of owning a console and accessories in Imperial Stormtrooper livery.
346,Kenny Tran,2021,5,Excellent console. Happy with the purchase!
347,De'Aundre,2021,5,Not a single problem at all
348,Patricia Frizzell,2021,5,Hubby was extremely happy!!….only down side is could have been packaged better….outside box was crushed….went into panic mode.
349,Jorge Juarez,2021,5,Its a brand new console (not a second hand) for more details please read the description of the product.
350,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Awesome👍🏾👍🏾
351,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Fast load time great interface
352,Rebecca w,2021,1,"I paid over $900,they are only $500 what a joke"
353,TriciaInTexas,2021,5,Graphics are amazing and I can play backwards. So PS4 games as long as you have PS Play.
354,Ryan S. Wheeling,2021,5,It plays games and does it well
355,Ari,2021,4,"Got a treasure truck text the disc version was in stock for retail price so we jumped on it, took a few tries to secure. Sold out in about 20mins yikes! Definitely glad we waited it out & did not pay Scalper prices. Shipping was fast, delivered the next day. Boxes were intact & factory sealed. The console looks so sleek, & is bigger than I anticipated.There aren't too many PS5 games out that we play, but with the backwards compatibility we've been able to play all our PS4 titles so far. Graphics look great, games are smooth & vibrant on our 70in 4k TV, the remote is really cool, my son loves playing with it when he gets to lean it side to side in the direction he wants to go, however it only comes with 1 controller, when purchasing a 2nd controller keep in mind it does not come with a charging cord. The built in Mic has come in handy, but volume is low so a headset is a worthy investmentWe're really enjoying the console so far & excited for more games to be released. We haven't used it to stream any media as of yet."
356,Kyle dwight,2021,5,I was skeptical at first because you hear about these places not shipping the product or the wrong one. But I have had it a week with no problems
357,Luke,2021,5,I'm basically using this as a PS4 Pro since I had a ps4 slim and it could barely do 30 in most games. There aren't much PS5 games out right now so might as well play those amazing PS4 games in glorious 4K/60fps!
358,Ernesto,2021,5,Earlier than what I expected!! Great quality
359,SZ,2021,5,This is just the best console period. Worth the wait and hype.
360,raymond jacques,2021,5,"This system is amazing.  I know the price was high, but I don’t regret it.  Truly an amazing experience.  Thank you"
361,Queen Jones,2021,5,Good for the price and quick on the delivery I purchased  the console for my husband. Great timing. Thanks
362,Amar H,2021,5,Love this thing
363,Peedah Pagah,2021,5,Great console. Sony wins the console war again!
364,Landon,2021,5,Even with price gouge it's legit 👌 spend it if you have it. Thank You got a day early 🙌
365,Faizan,2021,5,Incredibly fast and responsive plus the controller is a game changer.Hopefully we see more games take advantage of the extra horse power in the coming years
366,Maurice Washington II,2021,5,I absolutely love my PS5!!!
367,MOD,2021,5,"Tried to get regularly since release, nada. Downloaded a stock update app, boom got one in less than 2 weeks! Do yourself a favor, get the app and stay by your phone ready to purchase."
368,Matthew P.,2021,4,Received yesterday and I did set it up and everything is working fine. Will update once I get too use it.
369,Mom Addicted to Target,2021,5,My son is incredibly happy with this updated system. His PS4 was starting to get tired. The system itself is modern and larger than I expected. The system is much quieter than the PS4 and the storage is great. He’s happy. I’m happy. I got an incredible deal through the treasure truck.
370,Anthony T,2021,5,Got mine in less than a week. Was expecting 2 weeks. Came in fresh condition. Great product.
371,Arepo,2021,5,"Absolutely Incredible Console with Amazing Graphics, Super High Build Quality, etc as I can’t say enough Awesome Stuff About The PS5 as it’s Like Having A True High End Gaming Pc without the associated Price Tag since We Get The Entire PS5 for only $499 which is what an equivalent 3070/6800 GPU alone by itself would cost of which Pc gamers would easily spend $1600 dollar’s to build a Pc to match the Specs, and performance capabilities of the PS5"
372,Spain,2021,5,PS5 box had a few minor scratches but all the contents intact and new. Very happy! 😊
373,smitthi sukchoksirichaiporn,2021,4,Poor shipping quality. Box and content came damaged.
374,Xuruo,2021,5,"Really a hard experience to have my PS5. Basically looking at Tweeter everyday. But anyway! I get it!Just one day delivery, pretty fast! Good quality, and saved money from buying a TV box."
375,Daniel C,2021,5,"Soooooo Happy i was able to get my hands on one of these, THANK YOU !!!!"
376,Paulcholio,2021,4,"For me, the PS 5 is a very good machine.  I is my main non-PC gaming console at this time... but it was a bit of a luxury, as my PS4 still works great.  Due to what cons there are, I really recommend waiting for the M2 drive slot to become officially unlocked with an affordable M2 drive to be able to be purchases to expand the internal storage memory to be sufficiently expanded AND to be able to purchase the console at its MSRP price (or lower).If you absolutely don't or can't wait,  I only recommend purchasing the PS5 if 1) Your PS4 has died, 2) There are specific PS5 titles you want to play now and just can't wait, 3) You have money to spare totally on a luxury.PROS:Fast, excellent performance.Excellent, HD graphics.Comfortable controllers.Compatible with the PlayStation VR headset with the free adapter you can order from Sony PlayStation.I am able to play my entire PS4 library. 100+ games so far without issues.PS5 titles that are releasing look awesome. I so far have only 1 PS5 title, but it plays great and I love it.All the popular streaming services are available for the PS5: Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Disney, etc.Can use up to a 8 TB external drive for all your PS4 titles to make room for PS5 titles on the internal storage memory. (Note: You can only use 1 external drive at a time, but you can swap them by properly stopping the current drive before unplugging it and plugging in the new one)All 4 USB ports are high speed USB 3.1 ports with one of them being a type C port, Ideal for an external SSD for storage expansion and playing your PS4 games.Has a M2 SSD slot for M2 SSD hard drives to increase the internal storage, once Sony releases the unlock on the slot (BUT see the cons for the exception to this point).Comes with the stand instead of having to buy one separately, and it is used both for horizontal and vertical positions.Both the top and bottom panel covers are not only easily removable for component installation/replacement/repair, the covers can be easily replaced with 3rd party covers, so you can change the color of your panels.CONS:BIGGEST CON - It only has about 667 GB of SSD onboard memory, which will be eaten up quickly by newer software titles, AND the M2 SSD internal expansion slot is locked and unusable at this time, as Sony wants to be sure of the models and configurations of the M2 drives are 100% compatible with the console and it's current capability to dissipate the heat generated by the M2 SSD drives.  It's been over a year, and they still have yet to unlock the expansion slot.  Because of this con, and if you already have a PS4, I recommend holding off buying this until they unlock the M2 slot, or unless your PS4 dies and are looking for a replacement.  I have bought an 8TB external SSD for my PS5 to play all my PS4 games from, but it literally added $650 to my overall cost of my PS5.The console housing is allot thicker that it's predecessor consoles by almost double in thickness, so plan accordingly.Has a total of only 4 USB slots:  2 rear USB 3, 1 front USB 3, and 1 front USB type C.  The problem with this is if you have the PlayStation VR, a external SSD for PS4 games and PS5 storage, and utilize a charging cable for the controller, all ports will be taken up.You can use only 1 external drive at a time, making it awkward to transfer files and vids to your dive for viewing on your PS5, or increasing your storage further past the external 8TB.They removed the web browser and only have a limited, lockdown browser that is meant only to be used with their online PS5 guides and tech support manuals and forums.  Youtube, Twitch, and many other streaming media platforms are still available through their individual media apps on PS5.Only comes in white with black trim, and all the accessories (except the controllers) are also only available in white with black trim."
377,Anthony,2021,5,Love the system
378,Sami,2021,5,Good Product
379,Jose Wonsang,2021,5,"Came in less than 24hrs, I'm so happy"
380,Eli Fladell,2021,5,"Just arrived today, I bought the ps5 for the markup price. Honestly worth it. It seems to work perfectly fine, didn't come damaged whatsoever and am just waiting on the data transfer from the ps4, shipped fairly quick as well. Showed up 5 days early"
381,Avishai Rostamian,2021,5,Best console ever. The graphics that the PS5 can handle is so fantastic. I really love how fast it is too. Now I can play in style with my friends. I really do love this console and hope you can all get one like I did!
382,Tenet,2021,5,"I've had this console for 3 months now and it is awesome. I can load large games like Vahalla in 5-7 seconds. Plus, the quick resume is crazy impressive. For example, I started Vahalla after 2 WEEKS of not playing it and it picked up in a campaign mission right where I left off!!! The console is very quiet. Graphics are super sexy, I highly recommend getting a TV that can take advantage of the 4K at 120fps. The new controller is comfortable with a better texture grip and d-pad. Overall, this is the best gaming console ever built. The UI is streamlined and super user friendly as well."
383,Rotas,2021,5,"Absolutely Incredible Console with Amazing Graphics, Super High Build Quality, etc as I can’t say enough Awesome Stuff About The PS5 as it’s Like Having A True High End Gaming Pc without the associated Price Tag since We Get The Entire PS5 for only $499 which is what an equivalent 3070/6800 GPU alone by itself would cost of which Pc gamers would easily spend $1600 dollar’s to build a Pc to match the Specs, and performance capabilities of the PS5"
384,Britney G.,2021,5,Got it delivered in two days! Worth the wait to pay retail price instead of buy off of scalpers. Works AMAZING!!
385,Annmarie Francisco,2021,5,Thank you Treasure Truck!! I’m so excited that we were able to finally get our hands on one! It’s perfect and my husband was so happy.
386,Iwa Kun,2021,5,It's a PS5. What more can I say? Miles faster loading my PS4 games than my PS4. The transfer from system to system definitely would've taken a lot longer if I didn't have an Ethernet cable (highly suggest doing this).
387,Edward,2021,4,"works great, love it, ps5 is the best"
388,AmazonCustomer,2021,4,"love that the fact i have a ps5 but it's so hard to get, worth the money"
389,Mario ,2021,5,The shipping was good and the console was awesome.
390,Shay Holmes,2021,5,My son is extremely happy with his new PS5. We have been trying since Sony released them in November to purchase one to no avail. Amazon sent a notification on Wednesday that they had them in the Treasure Truck and on Friday it was delivered. I have never been disappointed with any of my multiple orders through Amazon. Thanks Amazon for your amazing service.
391,Jacks153,2021,5,We love how modern it looks! The graphics are amazing - my boys love the controllers- easy to hold etc
392,Josie Tejedor,2021,5,Twitter alerted me of the in stock for anyone who cares..
393,Fernando,2021,4,I was able to get it throught treasure truck. Amazon delivered in 2 days. Works great. It's a bulky console but oh well...
394,Derrick Thomas,2021,5,absolutely love this.  far better than the xbox series x.
395,Amano Chan,2021,5,"There's nothing to dislike about it, its next gen and its the Playstation 5."
396,Douglas Neff,2021,5,Loading times are nice and fast for every game I've played. No problems so far. I was fortunate to get this for 500.
397,Carlos Gonzalez,2021,5,"Get a PS5 is an imposible mission, I was very lucky get one thanks to the treasure truck alert txt messages.I was very happy with the shipping the very next day."

403,C. Wyman,2021,1,"Don’t waste your money, wait for supply to catch up with demand, or this sort of thing willKeep happening. Until then, play your PS4."
404,Alexander P,2021,1,Overpriced
405,April Costa,2021,1,For this price you can buy a good gaming PC which you can do more with and games are cheaper.
406,Pravar,2021,5,Amazon shipped it really quickly and overall it’s a really nice console.
407,Brendan N. Charney,2021,1,Get a gaming PC instead of being price-gouged!
408,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Awesome
409,Adam Borja,2021,5,When I placed the order Amazon sent it to me in a timely manner. I play games daily and this thing is amazing. I can’t get over how stunning the graphics are at 120Hz. Highly recommend!
410,fortrock,2021,1,Almost a full year since the release date and very few to none of the most loyal PlayStation customers have been able to play the games let alone on a system that they own.  I hope everyone jumps ship on Sony to teach them a valuable lesson about how they treat their customers.  I certainly won't buy a Sony product ever again.
411,Christian,2021,5,"Excelente consola, buena imagen, buen sonido, probada con una tv oled LG C1, como se disfrutan los juegos, en lo personal la recomiendo, mucho mejor que la ps4"
412,Kiril Vasilev,2021,5,"The PS5 is exactly what I wanted out of a next-gen device. It is fast, looks futuristic, runs games excellently, the internet speed is great, and the controller is probably the best part about the whole console. The only thing that I don't like is the lack of storage. In 2021 800 gigabytes of storage is not enough for many games, and while the console allows games to be stored on an external HDD or played on an external compatible SSD, the fact you have to spend another $200 for an SSD is dumb. The new Call of Duty alone is about 200 GB making it 1/4 of all the storage on the console, add another 100 for the system software and its almost 1/2 of all the storage you have taken by a single game. Everything else is perfect and easy to set up and use."
413,Nick,2021,5,"All those companies(Nvidia, Sony, Microsoft). They can't produce fast enough because of the chip shortage. It's the same with Cars and Trucks.Buy one at 399 or 499, don't give scalpers any more power.So everyone, calm down."
414,Robert F. Stevens III,2021,5,"Love the PS5, and so do the kids!"
415,ZAPP,2021,4,"PS5 IS THE BEST CONSOLE EVER MADE BY SONY so far, alot better than xbox"

421,Tyler D Williams,2021,5,Very fast shipping great product.
422,Matt Ferrara,2021,5,Great graphics
423,MIT Grad,2021,5,"Well, it is a PS-5, so of course it is a good product--IF, AND ONLY IF, you can get one w/o paying some scalper twice the price on ebay.  I just object to that.  Amazon (And other retailers) did not seem to attempt to help you, but Sony is trying.  If you register for an account with them, or if you have one, go update some items, and add say a PS5 controller or other PS5 accessory to your cart, you will likely get an email inviting you to buy one during a two hour window.  This works--at least for me, and some other folks I spoke with.  Sony seems to do this every couple of weeks.  1. Follow their instructions.  2.  Before the window opens, have a browser (The default one that email links open on your device.) open and be already logged into Playstation.  3. Click on the link around one second after the clock hits the start of the window.  4. Add the PS5 to your cart.  5. Hit checkout, and enter credit card info.  [Site did not pick up on my card already stored in the site.]  6. Hit purchase (After the review step.)  7.  Hit it again.  8. Be patient--it may take a few minutes.  9. Want to be a hero Dad?  Do this NOW.  If you wait until end of September, or later, the Christmas rush will be on and this will not get easier.  Good Luck.For the Amazon folks attempting to battle the scalpers and scalper bots--you need to do better."
424,Brian,2021,5,System is great and somewhat easy to set up. Buying it was a bit of a pain with site issues and errors but was able to snag one.
425,Nick Scangarella,2021,5,I was really satisfied with the shipping precautions. My box came in great condition.
426,Matthew A. Doyle,2021,2,I liked how fast I was able to get it. disliked that it was supposed to be new but it was not
427,Cypherx0001,2021,5,"Love it, surprised I got it for retail since this product is sought after.. graphics are amazing and how realistic the controller scenes feel is Astonishing .. excited to see what games come out for it but by far my favorite PlayStation yet!"
428,Nathan U,2021,5,Great games. Great visuals. BUY MORE PLAYSTATIONS
429,jccheng,2021,1,Please support 1440p output Sony!
430,Amazon Customer,2021,5,It’s a PS5. If you’re blessed to get one it’s worth the struggle. Just the decrease in load times coming from previous gen consoles is worth it . Happy hunting !
431,Nickolas Alaniz,2021,5,Great product
432,A,2021,5,Finally got one! Worth the wait!
433,A,2021,5,Worth the money
434,Stephen A,2021,5,"I am so happy that I am finally able to get one of these for retail after waiting almost a whole year for them after their initial pre-order went out of stock within seconds. I think there should be a queue for the next time this is released for a smoother checkout but that is just my suggestion.Anyway, as for the product, Sony has once again done the undoable. They have went above and beyond presented in the PS4. The graphics was so vivid and lifelike and the transition from scene to scene was so smooth. It does heat up after prolonged use of 2-3 hours of gameplay but once it starts doing that I would simply shut it off for another day.The game selection is also very nice since I can choose from the library of games online and/or use PS4 games."
435,KenL,2021,5,They do exist!
436,Willloki,2021,5,"been waiting so long to purchase a ps5, everything works great!"
437,R. Garcia,2021,5,No complaint quicker loading game play and improved graphics
438,Madan Gandavadi,2021,5,Its kinda over hyped. It took me months to get and its mediocre at best.
439,PeterSerrano,2021,5,I love this PS5 Console and Amazon delivered good 👍
440,John T.,2021,5,It’s awesome

442,SSK,2021,5,Yes I do recommend
443,Gilberto Quintero,2021,5,Kids love it!
444,a.trabeck,2021,5,"After a long wait to get my hands on a PS5 for my son I finally said eeffff it just going to have to spend a few extra $$ to get it. Nothing bad to say just a PS5 console, plays great, awesome graphics, great machine. The only thing that kinda got me by surprise is how big it actually is, dwarfs the PS4. I've read and seen some pictures on reviews so I kinda knew about it already, but in person a lot different, but thats it. Other than its a great machine. Would by again if I had to. The seller processed the order and received within a few days later."
445,Joshua T.,2021,5,"Rapido envio, producto nuevo y sellado, funciona perfecto"
446,Matthew,2021,5,"I had a PS4 since launch in 2013 and it had clearly shown signs of wear. Instead of replacing controllers and such, I sold it and purchased this. Not only is the PS5 fast, quiet, and look amazing (on the TV, not sitting on my floor because it’s too big for my TV stand) but it can be a true entertainment hub. The apps work great and switching between games and streaming is seamless. 4K HDR looks amazing on it and the console will definitely continue to be my go-to so long as they continue to churn out instant classics and provide useful software updates."
447,Joshua Bennett,2021,3,"Pay $824.97 4 this PS5 with 1 contrlr /no games. it is Disc version w Blue-Ray, also 1st time buyrs  Disc loads face up,  ordered the 9th got it 16th. + 400bucks to the price If u want one bad enough as I did to get soon your stuck paying an extra $450 to $1000 USD over initial retail prices of 499.97"
448,C G,2021,5,I brought this as a gift for my grandson and if he didn't have to go to school I believe he would be attached for life. It is a great system that allows you to play your PS4 games on it as well.
449,Margarita Montenegro,2021,5,Thank YOUUUUU very much!
450,Ali,2021,5,Was kinda hard to get but I got very lucky and secured my very own ps5 I love this console is way better than the trash box one
451,Dr Gemini,2021,5,Got it for retail.  Freaking love it.
452,Dino Raul Becker,2021,5,"Great product I love this Ps5, I use it all the time and it came right away in the mail."
453,Jonathan Mueller,2021,5,"I got the Xbox Series S because I couldn't get the PS5. A few months later I was finally able to get one from Amazon. I can say that the controller alone makes the PS5 for me feel next gen. The Xbox just doesn't give me that same feeling. It is great for my young kid on lower quality TVs, but the PS5 is definitely better in so many ways for all the new next gen games. If you can get one... it is worth it."
454,Danny C,2021,5,What a great system!
455,Jeffrey Agnew,2021,5,"Very hard to get. Looks great on the LG CX, LG C1, or LG G1 OLED TV's. I highly suggest it."
456,Paula Arvedson,2021,5,"It's a replacement for PS 4 that was destroyed in a fire 18 months ago. We knew what we needed and that's what we got, timely delivery."
457,Ege Odabaşı,2021,5,For  six  moths I try to solve this problem but noone could help  to me.  I m not happy to buy this pc form yor website  so I want to give  back  and refund me money pls
458,Midwest Boy,2021,5,The performance upgrade from the PS4 is very noticeable.  No more heavy fan noise and starting a game takes less then 20 seconds.  Highly recommend!!
459,Anonymous Gamer,2021,4,"I had my doubts about the 4k capabilities given its not native, however I was surprised and delighted after I played on it.  I would recommend if you are hesitant about upgrading from the last gen consoles."
460,LT,2021,5,No issues with power supply or HDMI handshake like some people. Amazing 4k performance
461,Rafael,2021,5,Really enjoy playing on the playstation 5. After using it for a few months. It is totally worth the upgrade from a ps4. Download and loading times are quick. Can't wait for some good games to release.
462,John,2021,5,ps5 exceeded my expectations
463,esco ,2021,5,It’s huge! So make sure you have room to place it!
464,Richard Holmes,2021,5,We were skeptical coming from our PS4 Pro... but the speed and power are an amazing upgrade and our family is having a blast playing Spider-Man and MLB 21 The Show.  Great buy if you can get it for retail!
465,Titan Brave,2021,5,Seriously best console on the market!
466,Edward castillo,2021,5,Gracias por el delivery  tan rapido estoy super contento con mi ps5
467,PKPS5,2021,5,"Love the PS5  Seriously playing Demon Souls is super fun and even though dying is frustrating, you respawn so fast on the PS5 it's sick. I can go from main menu to playing a PS5 game in like 8 seconds. It's crazy fast. I had a PS4 and rarely played it. I play on this all the time even play old PS4 games just because the controller and the experience is so amazing."
468,Tobias,2021,5,Great load speeds and graphics compared to ps4. I am always the first in lobbies loading up cross platform games

482,Emeka Ugokwe,2021,5,"Wow what an incredible console. For context, I also have a Series X and a custom gaming computer with a 3090/5950x in it.There's nothing like experiencing a console on your big screen. And Sony has managed to take it to the next level with this.It's well worth the effort in attempting to get one, and if you find yourself reading this review without one in hand, don't be discouraged. Follow Twitter stock notifications and turn on post notifications. and TRY. You will get one!"
483,Joseph E. Humphrey,2021,5,Seller shipped and delivered flawlessly! Notified me of serial and tracking number right away. Packaging was well done as well. I am well satisfied with this seller and the product.

505,Catmandonut,2021,5,"I like to have my games on disc, rather than digital only. I also buy games on Steam but wish the old days of having copies of games on DVD was still popular so I wouldn't hit my stupid Comcast cap trying to download the latest games. The PS5 disc version is where it's at for me, plus then I can sell games I don't like and still get some money back from the local game store. I heard Sony has sold over 10 million and is now just starting to make some money on these! Now to just find some for friends and family..."
506,LeonXie,2021,4,No need to put good words lol everyone wants it. Just too hard to get on original price.

517,Edin Selimovic,2021,5,"Great purchase, great quality"
518,Robert Owens,2021,3,"Honestly, the console is great. The games look good, loads super fast, has high frames, and 4k gameplay. Awesome! But its still such a buggy mess! I have to go through a new controller every few weeks and its super frustrating, sometimes it wont even start and I've had to factory reset it 2 times now and on top of that almost every game I've played crashes after about of half an hour of gameplay which causes me to lose progress on my games. It's a disappointment that it still has this much bugs even after all this time."
519,Bryce Merrill,2021,5,"Was hesitant to purchase due to the high demand, but it did arrive in a timely manner and undamaged. Full product arrived and didn’t show it had been opened."
520,Chris_Mijit on tiktok,2021,4,theres no games worth getting the system for. its mainly just a bunch of quality of life minor upgrades.
521,Evan,2021,5,Exactly what you would want out of a next gen system! I am loving this system and its power has not even begun to be tested!
522,Willson,2021,5,Works great. Loading screens are lighting fast. Games are great and the visuals are crispy. Excellent system and hardware.

526,LezGrl79,2021,5,
527,The Bryce,2021,5,"Man this pandemic got me down. But this PS5 keeping the ""lonelies"" at bay. I'm a gamer from NES original and had every system since then and this one takes the cake. The graphics and loading speeds...plus the sleek look. Amazon shipped in like 2 days in a non descript box which was awesome to me. I love this console. And i loved paying retail to amazon and not scalper rates."
528,V,2021,5,"Honestly it was a struggle to actually buy one of these, but the PS5 is amazing!"
529,Just facts,2021,5,Love my ps5  the graphics are everything!! I feel like that little kid again!! Fast shipping no issues!! Get one!! The details in the graphics I can’t say enough u feel like u are in the game!!! Lighting speed!

533,Robert J. Affleck,2021,5,Pretty fantastic system
534,Roger Aimable,2021,4,I wish it still had an internet browser and storage for your non gaming pictures and videos but outside of that an amazing product
535,Devin Bender,2021,5,Great if you can get one
536,Joshua T.,2021,5,"Ordered with standard shipping & it arrived from cross country in exactly one week. Product shipped in a plain box so no one knew what it was, thank God. PS5 worked 100% perfectly, which I was worried about. Seller responded quickly. The only thing that sucked was the price but I think it was worth it. Only a few hundred extra to have it early & with piece of mind in attaining it."
537,mcgarto,2021,5,"Was able to snag one at retail value, so happy about that. Games play much better on the PS5 than the OG PS4. Gta online plays at at stable 30fps in the city in a 30 player session. Can’t wait for the PS5 version to come out."
538,Omar Attia,2021,5,"Honestly, it’s worth it. Everything about the disc edition Ps5 is great, from design, quality to gameplay and even main menu. The one thing I would say that is annoying is the size of the storage since nowadays a lot of games need up to 500gb (call of duty) to install . Come on Sony why not go all the way to 1TB!"
539,Xander Fergerstrom,2021,5,It good
540,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Great product
541,sa xiong,2021,4,Gotten mine the retail price! Loving it!
542,Jrsnkrs89,2021,5,No need for a review. Was just lucky to grab one. Thank you Amazon for easy checkout!
543,Kindle Customer,2021,1,"Thankfully my phone charger is the USB type C cord, which is NOT included and absolutely necessary to even begin to use a PS5. (At least my daughters toys are labeled on the outside of the package that batteries are not included)My ps4 pro has more saved game data than the ps5 has storage for. The ps5 system has a funky bulky retro feel that takes up more counter space than the slimmer ps4 pro.I purchased this bundle at over 2x retail with NO extra games,  headset or controllers because it had the fastest delivery date in comparison to much better valued bundles, however the shipping was ""unforeseeably delayed"" and arrived at the same estimated arrival date as better valued bundles were quoting.If you have a ps4 account already, you will want to plug the ps5 in side by side to transfer data, or be stuck on a data transfer screen until you do.Update 2wks later::We've been running the PS5 and 2 PS4 Pros via same type of ethernets side by side in COD Cold War, Warzone, and Modern Warfare for 2 weeks. Here is our family's results.Ps5-dowloads the games faster and loads into game lobbies faster, the few titles it can hold at a time at least.Ps4 Pro- same shooting speed as ps5 (if not possibly advantageous lag in competitive shooter games) and more storage for another big game.Overall we have decided we will not be ordering any more PS5s until a pro version is released, or the price drops dramatically. It's not worth even the retail price for our use."
544,maria,2021,1,Box came rippedPoor quality control and handling from Amazon.First time I’ve ever ordered a console from Amazon themselves and most likely the last

562,Algernon Cokley,2021,5,My son loves this console very much. Thank you
563,KPM,2021,4,"So far I really like it. I've mainly played ps4 games with the exception of ff7 remake ps5 upscale but overall I like it. The new ui takes some getting used to and I'm still not sure it's a better ui. I'm hopefully some updates will come that allow for better ui layout and themes.It's much quieter than my ps4 in terms of fan noise and disc noise. I have not challenged the console to run anything exceedingly high res but everything I ran has looked great so far.The controller is similar but a little bigger than the ps4 controller and so far some of the feedback in the triggers is more distracting than immersive.Overall I'm happy I got it as my ps4 was starting to die. I liked that sony offered backwards compatibility with digital games and physical discs.It's a good enough console that carry through until the next one but definitely not a generational defining console like ps2, ps3 and to some extent ps4."

573,Yeimy Ortiz,2021,5,Everything working perfect for now 💕🙏🏼 Thank you early husband birthday  present 🎁
574,Teddy,2021,5,Love the PS5 such an amazing upgrade from the PS4 . The controller with its haptic feedback will immerse you in the game like no other. The SSD inside is blazing fast and you will be spoiled by how fast it is . My only problem is that it seems like the memory provided isn’t enough and you will run out of space after a few games . Definitely recommend
575,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Bought a scalped ps5 from them. Product arrived quickly and was in perfect condition. A lot of the reviews on here made me nervous, but I’m here to tell you they are great! they were very responsive within their business hours (weekdays 9-5). I had zero issues receiving my item."
576,GreenGo,2021,5,"Definitely feels next-gen especially with the upgrades done to the controller. Load times are significantly reduced and you can expect increased frame rates in your favorite PS4 titles. If you get the chance, snag one."
577,Shanordo Scott,2021,5,"Awesome piece of equipment on the other hand it doesn’t have the option of built in browser so can’t get to the anything beyond the ps5 apps and network. Insanely fast processing, download, and load in general with pretty good storage space. Now imma be real because buying this console for anything beyond the factory price can eat all sizes of rat turds and horse orifices. Not worth being haggled by a bunch of internet punks wait and keep trying to get one the good ole way without relying on bullies who can’t seem to find better means of making money"
578,Jakob,2021,5,"The ps5 is the best system out at the moment. Backwards compatibility with PS4 games, quick, very futuristic, and enjoyable. Great exclusives. It can't get any better."
579,sarmad yonan,2021,5,Love it
580,Jeannie,2021,5,"This is my first Playstation Console ever. For as long as game systems have existed, I’ve been an Xbox fan. The PS5 gives me the opportunity to explore a whole new world - A world where most of my family lives, in a wide variety of shooter, RPG, Open World and Adventure games. So far, I’m blown away by the graphics and the Dual-Sense Controller!  My first game is Ghost of Tsushima. I just started it yesterday and it’s fantastic! I will say, the jump from the Xbox Controller to the PS5 Controller is Olympically huge! I’m still trying to get used to the total change in functionality.Paid way too much for this system, but I have no regrets."
581,Mark,2021,1,"They love this publicity at the expense of their paying customers. It’s better for business that people are “scrambling” for ps5s and not xbox and they wanna keep the exclusivity going for as long as possible, only offering drops and pre orders to influencers or celebrities to boost their marketing. There is no reason it should be like this anymore"
582,Amazon Customer,2021,1,"Terrible app performance, blank screens, and scalper prices. I’m screaming into an echo chamber here, but it can’t be overstated the Amazon has joined the ranks of Walmart, target, and GameStop to screw over the consumer"
583,Byron H.,2021,1,This terrible how Sony launched this console...
584,Peter J. Jenkins,2021,1,"Amazon, you're supposed to be one of the greatest tech companies of all time. You can put Jeff into space but can't get a restock right? I clicked the add to cart button 30 times, after reloading each time. Always an internal error of some sort."
585,:-),2021,5,"Awesome Purchase. However, the seller price gouged their customers. Should be a law for one to do this....."
586,Joe Hanna ,2021,5,"I migrated from the ps4 pro to this huge thing and I am not disappointed whatsoever. The seller I bought it from communicated with me every step of the way and made sure I was satisfied with everything during the process and I got it in a timely matter, also got it on time! All in all, if you can’t wait until December like me, invest in Direct Distributors’ listing for 900+. You won’t be disappointed!"
587,bart,2021,2,not worth the money  needs external  memory
588,heguancheng,2021,5,good
589,Jordan Centeno,2021,4,"Buen producto hasta ahora ningun fallo, ruido casi silencioso, tiene un poco de cold whine con juegos de ps5"
590,samson23,2021,5,PS5 is amazing and the seller was great as well . Item was shipped right away and we had our PlayStation within 2 days .
591,Christian Hernandez,2021,5,Obviously a great console have had it for a month now and no problems with it. I hope whoever is reading this has scored one or eventually gets lucky to have one
592,GMB706,2021,5,Nice!! Amazon is the GOAT!! They came through when others COULDN'T!!
593,Mikaylah Gross,2021,3,Cons:They need the ability to add more storage to the playstation 5.  Sony only allows for external hard drives right now that won't store PS5 games.As I am writing this review playstation 5 still doesn't have Atmos support.  I bought a couple of 4k uhd bluerays and tried to get my (Sonos 5.1 Atmos setup) arc soundbar to work with no luck.  I tried many online tutorials and it still registers Dolby digital 5.1 and won't do Dolby digital + just Dolby digital.  I have 2018 firesticks and it still has Atmos support.  Xbox has Atmos support and I think this is a big con for PS5.  Dolby Atmos is a big improvement to sound in a room.System gets very hot.The cons are able to be fixed with updates.Pros:Solid interface and a  great console for streaming and playing your favorite sony game titles.
594,Karen Schultz,2021,5,"My son is a huge fan of Sony, he's had every system n loved them, when the time came for preorder we nvr had a chance, then waited everytime one a store, gone b4 it even began..Now i see ppl trying 2 sell them for twice or 3 times their original price..? Yes! Their amazing systems in every way, but selfish ppl want to gouge, i can deal w his disappointment, its only a matter of time b4 the excitement is over n the system are waiting to be bought at their CORRECT price, So enjoy ur 5-6 PS5s, maybe someone will buy 1 @ ur god awful price, i just wait........."
595,Christina Meyer,2021,1,Xbox is better. There is way more in stock. Go buy one.
596,Ben B.,2021,1,You know what you are if you pay this price. You also should already know what you are for charging this price!
597,Dwight,2021,5,This thing loads fast! I'm so glad I was fortunate enough to buy one here.If I get a chance to buy another.I do wish I went with the digital version though. Nowadays it's better to buy games digitally instead of getting discs.
598,Gary,2021,5,I got a ps5! Happy! Happy! Joy! Joy!
599,Daniel R.,2021,1,Scumbag
600,Mizzie99,2021,4,"Its great, the hard drive is fast. I just got it so still trying to see how well it works. But other than that. It came fast. Suppose to come on a thursday, arrived on a wednesday. A lil pricey but its expected."
601,Martin G.,2021,5,I just want to say that It’s legit and that I’m great full that it wasn’t a scam but if you can afford to by a ps5 then go ahead but if you are willing to wait then just wait and get it for cheaper
602,Dorette B.,2021,5,As my son said “MUM” simply amazing. I would say he’s very HAPPY .I entered his room and the system is very quite don’t hear a sound like when he had the ps4 Pro.
603,Devon Fitzpatrick,2021,1,"Possibly the most calculated launch to put the everyday fans at such a major disadvantage. With scalpers and the calculated move of releasing in midst of a pandemic where shortages were already plentiful, Sony is probably raking the cash on consoles selling out to scummy scalpers that’ll upcharge the crap out of the device, whether you get the standard or the version that was supposed to be more affordable, if Sony actually cared about it’s fan base rather than the money they squeeze out of us than they’d be proactively taking steps to prevent scalpers or just to produce a reasonable and consistent amount of consoles"
604,Laurie,2021,5,"Amazon is the literal GOAT. I love fragging newbs on this PS5. Thanks, Amazon!"
605,Johnnie,2021,5,Received within 2 days of Order. Fast quick and the download speed and resolution of the PS5 is big upgrade. Call of duty I seem to be loading in faster than others in lobby and seem to be able to have a sturdy game play. Internet connection I'm sure does have an affect on that but overall Madden Fifa Warzone all work great graphics are more intense and clear. Great if you can afford the cost. If you cant I'm telling you it's worth waiting for the price to drop. Dont put yourself in a bind.. it wont be much different than current game play on ps4 but worth it if affordable.
606,Antonio Mendez ,2021,5,Got what I paid for hopefully it doesn’t have any long term defects but so far so good 👍🏽
607,Luis Rivera,2021,5,Y’all Trippin trippin
608,Nick,2021,5,"Super fast, beautiful graphics, and amazing game choice. Only downside is how tall it is."
609,Carter Gregg,2021,5,"Pairs nicely with Nano 90 LG, HDMI 2.1 for the win!"
610,Amazon Customer,2021,5,This system is awesome really good graphic and game play well worth the money not the wait lol
611,William Sibert,2021,5,"price and demand but it is what it is, Seller ipuzzle shipped the console fast and packaged good and came on time."
612,Michael B.,2021,5,"The PS5 is shocking when you pull the protective layer back and see that white canvas for the first time. Having it next to a ps4 or Xbox 360, it casts a very big shadow. It's very quiet unless the console is downloading a game Disc, to which then it becomes quite audible. The controller is beautifully matched step for step but I recommend getting another one to keep as a backup or collectors item once your main controller has seen many years. The best airflow is in the vertical position and I wouldn't suggest setting anything on the canvas as it is not flat by any means.Powerful and beautiful, enough said."
613,C. F. Barnes,2021,1,At this point I'm still enjoying my PS4. Maybe someday when things get reasonable again. Sony really dropped the ball on this one. Amazon too. For allowing this scalping on their platform.  Shame on you!
614,Augustin ,2021,5,I've had the PS5 for almost 8 months now and i am very pleased. This device is such a refreshing upgrade from the previous generation. I love how quick the downloads are and how fast the games boot up. One of the first things you'll notice is the absence of sound from the fan. I am coming from a base PS4 and the difference in fan noise is night and day. It does take a bit to get used to the new UI but it starts to click after a while. The best new feature is the new controller. It offers a unique experience to games that support its functions. It adds a level of immersion and inter-activeness that is hard to explain. If you end up not liking it you can simply shut off those features.I cant wait to see what this generation of games has in store for the players.
615,joseph morales jr,2021,1,Time for a PC guys
616,TC,2021,5,best system out on the market at the moment
617,Courtney Williams,2021,1,"Upon opening the package I set up my new PS5. After completely plugging in the PS5, it does not work. I am now outside of the window of returning or trying to receive a new PS5 and am stuck with a brick that doesn't work, all thanks to AMAZON."
618,J. Cruz,2021,5,"Too many people are rating this a one star because you could not buy one??  That is not even a review. If you didn't get one it's because you were snoozing!First the look of the console is unique and futuristic. The controls are well built. The charger (sold separately) matches the console's cosmetic qualities. The media remote (sold separately) also matches the consoles texture and color.The PlayStation 5 is clearly ahead of any console. The games are smooth and stunning! Especially when played with an Oled TV. The colors are vivid and so detailed in 4k. The frame rate can go as fast as 120p with no lag, no stutter or crashing as some fake reviews on amazon claims.The PlayStation 5 is probably the most wanted console in history of PlayStation.  Because of the pandemic, parts are in short supply resulting in angry and frustrated customers who can't buy one. If you are smart you can get one by getting on a list with a supplier. You won't get it right away but eventually you will get an offer like I did. Good luck in finding one!"
619,Chelly,2021,1,Why would anybody pay that much for a PS5 that will lose  value when the ps5 slim comes out. There not even limited edition. I'll wait to buy it regular price. Not gonna contribute to this
620,Jose Vargas,2021,5,"This really is a next gen console. The graphics are  surreal the games look like movies and load times are virtually non existent. The games available are fantastic, although selection is limited. But even ps4 games play so much better on ps5. I switched from Xbox and I don’t think I’ll ever go back."
621,Sandro N.,2021,1,"Esta locos si piensan que pagare hasta casi el doble por una consola la cual especifican que esta nueva pero usada, una estafa."

629,Fenil Bodiwala,2021,5,Ps5 is really really good console to play. It works like charm.
630,AvidBuyer,2021,4,"I love the PS5. The loading times are insanely fast, so fast that there are no loading screens on the PS5 games (when playing PS4 games on the PS5 loading times are the same as PS4).The only downside is that the SSD is too small."
631,Amazon Customer,2021,5,
632,Alton,2021,5,Nice console.
633,Samir Ahmed,2021,5,Bought it from walmart in February but this is a great console.
634,Chosen One,2021,1,"As someone who has bought every PlayStation since the PS2, I have to say that overall, the experience overall is very good. All the things that took a bunch of time before, whether it’s regarding system tasks, or in-game screens, now happen in a flash. However, there are 3 main areas where they took a step back in my opinion, and 1 of them is why they only get 1 star from me:1) Messages and Party Chats used to be way more user friendly on my PS4 Pro. After a couple months of use it’s still so clunky to use because you can’t just start a party independently you have to start up a message group first, even if it’s with people you barely know, and then send an invite to the chat to the group. It’s a huge step backwards to me because it’s slow and now you have to leave all the message groups after each party you create or they pile up and bury your real message groups.2) The hard drive space. They took about a third of the usable hard drive space away from last generation and you feel it. I never needed an external hard drive, and it’s cool that it’s a feature to be able to use one, but for a $500 device to almost require an outside device for a basic functionality is in poor taste. I say almost because I have 5 games installed and I’m at full capacity. You may only play 1 or 2 games at once and just delete them so this won’t be an issue. For me, I like to have more choice readily available, and on my PS4 Pro I swear I had north of 10 games installed at once for whatever mood I was in. This isn’t a deal breaker but it is a minor/major inconvenience depending on who you are.3) This is the big one… I haven’t had the system long at all. It only just came out November of 2020 so no one has, but already, the controller is malfunctioning. It’s referred to as “drift”, where your character you controller will just move on their own without you moving the analog stick because of an issue with the analog stick. I can’t say I’ve never experienced this before with other systems, but not only was it rare, but when it occurred, it took years and years of playing before it happened. This system recently released and I’ve been busy so I haven’t played it much until recently now that it’s summer, and already I’m experiencing drift, and not minor drift like some old controllers, but major, makes the controller unusable even in the menus drift. The system is $500, the controller alone is $70, and you can’t use PS4 controllers with the system. All of these facts make it absolutely unacceptable that the controller would cease to operate correctly in such a short span of time. This is supposed to be premium tech, “next gen”, so the equipment should operate accordingly. The fact I’m now backed into a corner where I have to decide if I have to spend another $70 after a couple of months to replace the controller is a disgrace, and is the primary reason for my 1 star rating because the whole system is useless without faulty tech they included."
635,Gilbert Fong,2021,1,"Ii bought the ps 5 twice and sold to friends who really wanted it, I have a $2,000 gaming PC that is way better than the ps 5, there are no games for that system, PC all the way!"

They won’t fall for it. For those who are messing with the retail price, kiss goodbye with your dear ps5. The rest will wait a bit longer alright. But eventually, people will get what they want with a fair price!"
645,MasonicEagle32 ,2021,1,What a Joke. These dirtbag scalpers are scum you scrape off your shoe. I have been a Sony guy since ps1 but I've switched to Xbox for now. I hope these people get screwed over in some way.

647,josiah b northey,2021,5,I'm happy with the system. Runs great and everything looks amazing. The controllers dont seem to stay charged very long though.
648,Joyce Muoio,2021,5,Packaged great and fast shipping!
649,Gabo08,2021,1,This price gouging has literally made me consider going to PC gaming. For 1k I can definitely get a pc that will outperform a PS5
650,Eugene,2021,5,"Awesome console, very quiet, ps4 games are loading much quicker. Though had quite some trouble getting my hands on it, it all panned out."
651,Daniel S.,2021,2,"Console is excessively loud, even louder if you dare to use disks. In addition to that games available are horrid. None of them have really been any good at all. All COD games now take up a excessive amount of space on the limited hardrive. Hard drive only shows a available space of 668GB to begin with. And good luck getting any refunds on horrible games bought digitally from the game store. 2/5 would never buy again. Especially when it continues to be such a short stocked item. Cool controller though, to bad the controllers built in mic is crap and I can't manage to just get party chat to run threw any headset plugged in. Why can't I just enjoy my Bose and have a little ear bud for the crap party chat???"
652,Paul Spector,2021,5,"For such an incredible piece of technological innovation, the rollout of the PS5 has been nothing short of disastrous. Sony and its affiliated retails could have managed the rollout much better, and better implemented anti-scalping measures (e.g. $1K PS5s shouldn't be on Amazon).All that said, the PS5 really is worth the wait. It is a fun, fast, and innovative console and I am elated to have finally got my hands on one after seven months."
653,GREGORY P,2021,5,I love it
654,Ashley Likens,2021,5,Worth it he loves it. It also got here super fast and in great packaging
655,Kenny Vargas,2021,5,Came in fast and the graphics on it are unbelievable on my 8k tv. I cannot wait for my games and content to display on my 8k system and tv
656,Jon Kelley,2021,5,I love it. Runs games super fast even PS4 games are faster. I wouldn't get any other console if I was able to just kind of mad I didn't get the warranty. But that's my fault for trying to rush through the purchase. Otherwise 100% satisfied.

660,Tim,2021,5,"PS5 games look great. I’ve played RE8, Demon’s Souls, and Yakuza 7 and see the improvement. The menus and store are much faster than the PS4 which was honestly annoying a lot of the time with how slow it was. Definitely recommend trying to get one of these if you play a lot on PlayStation. Just keep an eye out for when one sold by Amazon is available."
661,Kiko281,2021,1,"All this so call entrepreneurs are messing everything up!! GET A JOB!!!! There’s no way in hell that I would pay 1,000 for a ps5 i guess only youtubers who make easy money are paying those prices."

664,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Awesome console. Was a PS4 owner previously and am very happy with the PS5 performance and load times. Just needs to come out with more console exclusives or just new games overall.
665,Mike,2021,5,"every time i turn on the power, i get an instantaneous erection"
666,Erica C. ,2021,5,"Arrived rather quick, but the box itself was beat to hell. Inspection and quality assurance needs a look over in the warehouse. The shipping box was in one piece so this happened prior to boxing for shipping. So far we’ve had no issues with the console itself."
667,Septimus Connor,2021,5,Excellent
668,David Hou,2021,1,"I will only buy the MSRP or less, not more."
669,Mark,2021,5,"I'm thoroughly impressed by this hardware. The improved run time for PS4 games that haven't been upgraded is great. The ones with upgrades run and look insanely beautiful, looking at you Spider-Man Remastered. Only a couple true exclusives to the platform so far that I can think of, Ratchet and Clank and Returnal, but they're fantastic and absolutely beautiful to see. I'm looking forward to seeing what developers start churning out if this semiconductor shortage ever ends, and the console install base hits a point its financially viable for them to focus on it. That said, im not sure I'd recommend a PS5 purchase just yet unless you're a fan of having the latest hardware, seeing as some of this year and next year's most anticipated AAA titles will be on PS5 and PS4, so long as publishers don't start charging for those upgrades."
670,Kyle walter,2021,5,"I bought this for myself and use it every couple of nights. After a couple of months having it I can safely confirm that it is a great purchase. The device arrived with no defects and no scratches. The box was a little beat up, but that was the only issue. 5/5 would recommend for anyone trying to upgrade consoles."
671,Del,2021,2,"this console is so not worth 500 bucks , i feel like im just playing a ps4 with a newer design (which looks lame imo , games do load a bit faster , thats about it"

685,Devin A.,2021,1,"....But sabatoging your own supply quantities to artificially increase demand, just so you, and every other scalper online can charge 2 or even 3 times the price of the product is just wrong. Look, I understand that a business needs to make money, but not at the expense of screwing over your customer base....I will be passing on this until the price is reasonable, and even then I might skip it on principle. Whats more, companies like squaresoft are releasing DLC for PS4 titles like Final Fantasy as PS5 exclusives....When did integrity, decency, and treating customers with respect die out? This is why people are really starting to hate large corporations and their out of control greed."

690,Steven Puckitt,2021,5,PS5 is a huge upgrade for me from my PS3. Works as intended. High quality feel. Fast load times. Good UI. I was fortunate to not have to pay scalper prices for one too. 100% would recommend.
691,Jayson Charles,2021,5,Console is the best
692,Justin,2021,1,"When finish the design of ps5 physical system will be $400 it can only all types of cds and download games, and digital download system will be $300(it can only download games, it can never use all types of cds.) Found info from game informer. Anyways ps5 is has a high price because people pre-order the system from ps5 earlier from playstation. Now those people are scammers. they sell the system at high price. On playstation they created some mistakes. 1 they have wrong amount of memory of the system on pre-order systems. The amount of memory is 625gb(gigabytes). It was supposed to be 1 terabyte (1,000gigabytes). 2 because we had Covid-19 many workers left/quit the job.Sony doesn’t know when they work at the playstation job. And 3 since playstation low on workers they have a slow time to create the playstation computer chip. So the system will run and play on playstation5. Now they think ps5 might come out end of the year or next year on March(they think it will come in March or some other days, weeks or months). For years they say ps5 will come end of the year. If ps5 doesn't come out fast, playstation might go out of business. To me I rate the system right now 0 stars."
693,Rey,2021,5,Amazingggggg! Even better when you get it regular price and not by the scalpers that try to sell it to you for $1000.

I know these are hard to find but just hang in there, eventually there will be enough so that you can walk in the store to get one. Even though it's an amazing system there still isn't much games to be played so you guys aren't missing much but if you can get your hands on one, I recommend buying it"
696,Andrew S.,2021,1,"No way this console is worth over $500... I'm not even sure its worth that much lol. As of now, there is literally no reason to own this console over a PS4 except the faster load times. No new exclusive games, same exact services the PS4 provides, etc. I can wait till 2030 when the PS6 is announced and these actually start becoming available... and even then I might just skip it lol. I have more fun with my GameCube anyways XD"
697,Amirkia,2021,5,"It is well know that the launch of this beautiful console failed emphatically! but after many tries I got lucky and I was able to get my hands on one, and mannn… it just hits differently!!!!!"
698,Alexander,2021,5,Best console ever
699,Chabeli,2021,5,"Was a gift for my boyfriend, took a while to get it, of course he’s very happy, works as it should, no issues whatsoever."
700,Néstor Colon,2021,5,Just awesome
701,JaY EveryDay,2021,5,Awesome
702,Joseph Ziad Jazrwy,2021,1,I'd rather let Queen Latifah take a dump on top of my head from a hot air balloon than buy this crap console.
703,Dittles ,2021,5,Excellent
704,Madara Uchiha ,2021,5,I'm so happy I was able to finally get a PS5 after trying so hard for 5 months thank you amazon this is the best way to get one because you can have all your information set up all you need to do is add to cart and buy now !!!!!! IMAGINE NOT HAVING A PS5 TUFFFFFF
705,Tony,2021,5,Came as described in brand new condition. My nephew will be happy with this.
706,Hannnah Sims,2021,5,It works great. My husband lives it.
707,Z.L.,2021,5,It’s so beautiful!
708,K,2021,5,The PS5 is worth every penny. The graphics are amazing. I love playing the Spider-Man game and COD.
709,Alexis Antonio Azuaje Laya,2021,5,I really like PS5. Maybe the color is not the best choice but as console is simple the best.
710,Luis Fernandez,2021,5,Amazing Console
711,Drew,2021,1,
712,Lluvia,2021,5,So far so good
713,juan martinez,2021,5,Exelente
714,Courtney K.,2021,5,Amazing console! So glad I finally snagged one!
715,rylan,2021,5,
716,Chris,2021,5,"Great system, the dual sense is amazing and makes games feel truly next gen. 60fps is a new world."
717,todd wester,2021,1,Bought a ps5 and all the games crash. Can’t get a hold of customer support and I have been trying for weeks.
718,Amila Kumara,2021,5,The best choice I made during the pandemic time.
719,Chris Kaiser,2021,4,Great purchase price and glad Amazon sold these. High quality material and the processor is fast and no lag time when I play games. Really aesthetic as well as it sits in my entertainment system. Can’t wait for when the release more games!
720,Shyam,2021,5,Powerful
721,Carlos V.,2021,5,What can I say. This boy is chonky but beautiful! Look at those curves🤤. I’m still waitng on a ps5 game that will just push this thing to its absolute limits! Overall gaming is just super fast even on games that aren’t taking full advantage of the hardware. Of course with pros there are cons. The main con I can think of is the storage. Overall storage is around 600 gigs. Seeing that PlayStation 4 games are extremely huge because they are built for outdated hardware. You will run out of space. Still patiently waiting on that update to add more storage internally. I highly recommend this console. That’s if you can find one lol. This is my 3rd console so far. I suggest following ign deals and snkr_twtr on twitter with notifications on. Not an ad for them trust me. I hate ign. They’re trash but good for getting a ps5.
722,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay. Loving it!"
723,Anthony A.,2021,5,I have struggled to get a PS5 all year but Amazon really did its job and allowed me to purchase this PS5 that I long-awaited.
724,Snelly,2021,5,All around good product. Just don’t pay Resell
725,Yareli Cruciani,2021,5,"Bought this for my husband. We've had a blast with Astro's Playroom, learning the new controller. It's so responsive and fast, almost no loading of new screens as we progress. The controller has a great weight/hand feel. Loving it so far!"
726,Carlos,2021,5,"happy with this console, although it cost me a lot to get it"
727,Phenom,2021,5,Perfect!
728,patrick,2021,4,"The fact that there is a big craze that has trained us to believe we need this... even tho there is much more potential from last Gen,hardly any developers are using it.. most games right now are remasters adding features that really do little to expand that particular game. That’s all fine and dandy but do you really want to pay more than what something costs just to have slightly upgraded graphics, because more time is being spent remastering old games then on new releases.. so when you look back months from purchase and say... you know that wasn’t even worth the 1k I spent on this... let me save you some money and tell you to either wait till you can get one at retail or buy a PS4 pro used from GameStop and get a warranty"
729,Viet Pham,2021,1,"I like Amazon because the way the handle the package is really nice. But, today is not it. The ps5 that I bought from Amazon, it's ripped like that when I opened the package. So disappointed"
730,HKG,2021,5,"Silent, fast and with a cool design, but there aren't enough ps5 games on the market now so no need to hurry I guess :)"
731,Raana,2021,5,Ps5 hype is real 3am drop amazon thanks
732,Frank ,2021,5,"I personally don’t have the option to buy a ps5 unfortunately. Some people are complaining about the system and saying it’s a rip off and it sucks because if the terrible launch, be grateful that you have the privilege to own one not many people do. I understand it all comes down to opinion and what people think but me personally I think it’s a great system for a great price and with all the features that I comes with even better, you can’t expect to have a powerful system like the ps5 with all its great features for a cheap price. If u want a cheap system? Then may I suggest the Xbox series S. I see that people are saying they bought the system at $1,500 and at that point you just got scammed and that’s on that person to blame. No one told you to buy the console at that price you could of just waited to buy it at the original price and the only one to blame is that person. But please don’t leave comments saying that “ooh it’s a scam or it’s bad or it’s a ripoff” don’t blame the company for mistakes that the consumer made."
733,Jeremiah Steffens,2021,5,"The PlayStation 5 is the next generation and I can definitely tell it sure is!The loading times are so short, the new haptic feedbacks and adaptive triggers give new immersion to games, the PS4 backwards compatibility let's me continue working on games I've haven't finished.I cant wait for more games to be released!"
734,Jose,2021,5,Great stuff! Fast delivery! Happy customer!
735,Fernando Valencia,2021,5,I love my Ps5 best system ever made
736,wangruimeng,2021,5,Nice and beautiful look and great proformance
737,Montrael Green,2021,5,No complaints
738,Amazon Customer,2021,5,I’m happy I got this console when I did. It was for my daughter bday May 14th. She was happy.
739,Raina,2021,5,My children loves the ps5!!!!
740,Chris Passerini,2021,5,I liked it came here in a week and I get to play PS5 games without having to trade in my PS4 games. It’s a great console!
741,Zoey,2021,5,"The PS5 is truly the definition of next gen gaming. From the controllers with their adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, to the consoles killer performance and surprisingly quite fans, The console is put together to make an amazing package for anyone who gets their hands on one. Please, if you are on the fence about this console, go for it."
742,Carlos Garaicoa,2021,5,"I would recommend to anyone. Graphics, gaming, movies, resolution is all awesome."
743,Marshall J. Stokes,2021,5,Absolutely love it.
744,Donald,2021,5,Amazon Had Fast Shipping Came SOONER Than My First Anticipated Date . The Console Itself Is Great As Well With Features Like Remote Play And Dual Sense
745,yuhzou gu,2021,5,"Love the console, finally able to get one for my little brother, which he dreams about it. For this price, it is the best game console so far, looking for more games, and hopefully I will able to get another one for my self."
746,OSCAR ARIAS,2021,5,Ok
747,Kodjo Gnamakou,2021,5,i cant wait to play GOD on it..
748,Tomye,2021,4,Waited all this time to get a PS5 and of course the box comes with a dent in it
749,Jaysone Asencio,2021,5,Good Product
750,nehemiah,2021,5,Yeaaaa boi
751,sandraoseguera,2021,5,"Console came in perfect conditions, amazing ps5"
752,Brodrick Thompson,2021,5,Great platform
753,andrew adamczyk,2021,5,Perfect
754,Brandon,2021,5,"Waited well over a few months to actually get one, but it was worth the wait. It took a little bit to adjust to my internet, but once it was settled in the games I normally play were much more visually appealing and smoother. The controller dies after a day or two (if you use it frequently), but charges really quickly. A wonderful console if your looking for a next gen console!"
755,Meech Godlove,2021,5,Very happy to have gotten one successfully and this is a reminder to all that it is possible ! Low stock but remain diligent and you will succeed
756,Hanjun,2021,5,Good
757,Kevin Pereda,2021,5,I love this product. Worth every penny
758,arm711,2021,5,"Sony has delivered a great piece of hardware at an incredible price! If you are a PS4 owner upgrade as soon as possible and if you're not a PS4 owner now's the time to become a PS5 one. Some of Sony's biggest, heavy hitting, critically acclaimed exclusive games have been patched and\or upgraded to take advantage of some of the PS5's processsing and graphical power. God Of War, Ghost Of Tsushima, The Last of Us 2, Spider-Man, and Ratchet & Clank. Not including the third party games that have also recieved similiar patches and\or upgrades. That coupled with the new Sony firsty party exclusive games and third party multiplatform games makes the PS5 a must buy!"
759,Pooky73,2021,5,
760,Tyler Fitzgerald,2021,5,"Absolutely one of the greatest consoles of all time, puts Xbox to shame, and I loved my 360 and One S, the graphics, the controller, the specs and gameplay, just absolutely phenomenal and astounding in it’s product, although it has a really terrible launch with high demand, that should be due to Covid and chip shortages, I love the Ps5!"
761,bob Mac,2021,5,It’s dope.
762,Amazon Customer,2021,5,This console is a great console to have the controller makes it a lot of fun hopefully it’s less tough to get soon.
763,The Goat ,2021,5,Perfect
764,David Meléndez Rojas,2021,5,Best console!!
765,Anstey Family,2021,5,"So i got lucky and happen to be awake at 3 am when this went into stock. If you’re trying to get your hands on a PS5, use Twitter notifications on restock Twitter pages. It helped me a ton. That being said. I love my ps5. He’s beautiful and plays fantastic and i use him almost everyday/night, in my opinion worth the money. Also don’t hold out for the digital, get what you can get because this was a bitch and a half to get."
766,Alfonso,2021,5,It's a nice box of Joy and looking forward to more games for PS5 platform. I did get an external hard drive to store and PS4 games on this platform.
767,Eduardo,2021,5,I couldn’t get a ps5 anywhere until my boy Bezos came thru with the drop
768,Wayne Aung,2021,5,"I upgraded from PS4 and man, this console is amazing! Definitely worth to upgrade from PS4 if you can buy this for retail price.Performance is very smooth. The only issue is, the PS5 generate a lot of heat, other than that, it is definitely worth to upgrade."
769,Nardia,2021,5,Everything I expected it to be and more
770,Thomas,2021,5,A pain to get ahold of but once I did I was blown away by the quality of this system and it's amazing controller.
771,piotr sowa,2021,1,"I am so disappointed with SONY for coming out with a product and not being able to fulfill the demand. Its been over 7 months since the release date and we still cant find it anywhere, what a shame and poor business decision."
772,Brenda bernardoni,2021,5,My 10 year old loves his PS5.. He bought it himself.. He said the headphones are the best too..
773,Luther,2021,5,Amazing
774,P.C,2021,1,so bad it made sony looks like a novice company
775,Kayode Adeola,2021,5,Packaging was solid. Delivery was fast. Console is a beast. Waiting for my favorite exclusives to be released to fully get my gaming groove on
776,Justin,2021,5,Use my Ps5 for streaming apps. Also to play games that are only for Playstation was the big reason why I wanted one so bad.
777,jonathan poo,2021,5,Arrived on time and as advertised in the site and thankfully wasn't sold out at the time
778,Genoa Campbell,2021,5,Waited a long time to get this console and was not disappointed.
779,Chelsea Sims,2021,5,"If you can manage to buy one, it’s a great system to have. Would buy again."
780,Rakhyun K.,2021,5,Nice
781,Justin B.,2021,5,It came packaged nicely and was up to expectations
782,Packs,2021,5,Mmonkdy
783,Jason Vargas,2021,5,Love the playstation 5. Got it for my friend and we're both playing Call of Duty together now. Great console and thankful I was able to get one finally
784,Yue Wu,2021,5,great

786,AmazonUser,2021,5,Super worth it. I haven’t owned a PlayStation since PS2. The graphics are amazing
787,Patrick Guertin,2021,5,Great! Thank you!
788,MacarioIgnacio,2021,5,Best console
789,Frank,2021,5,"The PS5 is great and love it. I was worried, due to Amazon shipping. The shipping box was damaged and you could see what was inside. Luckily it worked and it wasn’t stolen"
790,Kevin E.,2021,5,"I wasn’t sure if this was going to be a significant upgrade from my 4pro…. It is.I’d never pay scalper prices, but at retail, yeah it’s totally worth it….."
791,Hemanth Bangalore,2021,5,Can't wait to use it!
792,Prince oberoi,2021,5,"Finally was able to catch this deal, and pay retail price and not the marked up ones by third party sellers. Bought it for my little brother who was waiting patiently 9 months after his birthday to receive it."
793,Travis Jernigan,2021,5,Awesome. Super fast loading. Beautiful graphics.
794,Caliboyizhere,2021,5,"I mean, what can I say, it's a PS5."
795,Parant Family,2021,5,"It's sweet! Thanks, Amazon for doing the drop at 2 am. The best part now is the Dbrand black plates."
796,Christine Kain Singh,2021,5,Bought this just under a month ago. Great system and quick start up. Graphics are great. Plays most PS4 games as well.
797,Joshua Fellers,2021,3,What else can I say that has not already been said? I took off two starts due to major bugs that still exist many months later...
798,charles,2021,5,"By far the best console on the planet! 4k with 120hz you won’t ever leave your house! It took me 4 months to get one. 4 months of websites crashing and sellouts in seconds. When it came in stock on Amazon it was effortless. If your looking, add it to your wishlist. When Amazon gets stock don’t add it to your cart. Just go to your wishlist and “proceed to checkout”. Suck it Walmart!"
799,Magaña,2021,5,Son loved it!
800,Amazon Customer,2021,1,Just not really worth it
801,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"got this for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he has not stopped using it on his free time. would be a better gift in the winter but he was really happy with it. super fast, and looks really nice on our counter/tv stand. love the design"
802,Javier,2021,5,"It’s a bit too early to say that you should just buy it, but as far as can see, it’s worth the money. Graphics aren’t too different just yet and most games are still coming for PS4, however, that’s not the reason to buy a PS5 right now, the reason is to get that fluid 60fps experience with Playstation exclusives and next gen games with PS4 games getting upgrades to PS5 or already having uncapped FPS so they already can go to 60fps with no updates, also to get the near instant or no loading at all in newer games. Compared to my PS4 base, it’s dead quiet, I actually managed to forget that a game was running due to it not being a jet engine to tell me. One disadvantage would be storage, there’s simple bare minimum, if you install full Warzone and Black Ops, you already just have a quarter of the space for other games, not everyone have all components of those games at the same time, but I’m mentioning it just to get a sense of how small the storage is. But other that the storage, everything else is an upgrade. If you manage to get one, congratulation, you are almost all set for everything to come in the next couple of years."
803,Tiare,2021,5,So happy we finally got one for the right price. Came in nicely packaged too
804,Blake Leach,2021,5,I don’t think there’s much to say except for this is totally worth the upgrade I got this two months ago it runs amazing it is very easy to clean it’s not as big as you might think it is still very big but runs smoothly amazingly and the 4K HDR 60 frames per second looks so smooth and amazing on a big 55 inch screen as I have if you have a 4K TV and you want your games to look the best they could possibly look I would totally recommend this you can still play all your PS4 games and they will be boosted to 4K resolution if supported and 60 frames per second if it’s not locked at 30Totally worth the upgrade amazing consul greatest PlayStation of all time
805,michelle mack,2021,4,pretty much same as PS4 but with updated graphics
806,KS,2021,5,👍🏻👍🏻
807,Armando ,2021,5,Bought this for myself and so far I haven’t had any disappointments. Got it shipped to me on release day.
808,Roey,2021,3,"Great product, but had a software issue which needed to be fixed by Sony and took 2 weeks to repair. Fast shipping."
809,Jesus evangelista,2021,5,Ps5 expectations were flawlessLove it
810,Casey Smith,2021,2,Utterly disappointed with SONY. It’s super noisy. Mine had issues reading a disc straight off the shelf. Ugly and bulky. It’s atrocious to look at and too big to hide. Couldn’t fit it in any cubbies all previous systems have easily fit inside. Really can’t understand the appeal. I much prefer my Series X.
811,andy l.,2021,5,Not a single problem has been working perfectly!
812,Amazon Customer,2021,1,I received this item with the box ripped open and the controller is missing!
813,clarence terry,2021,5,Great product great store thank you
814,Erica G.,2021,5,This definitely made my sons day thanks Amazon for not letting us down…
815,Stacie S.,2021,5,"Fast, although VERY hard to purchase due to bots, super happy with its performance and speed!"
816,Lewis gullone,2021,5,Fast shipping great product!
817,Bobby H ,2021,5,"PS5 is awesome, I recommend researching how to follow alerts on Twitter to know when to buy on Amazon. Stock literally lasts only a few minutes. You may have to keep hitting the add to cart button multiple times. I tried about ten times before it landed in my cart. Good luck and happy gaming!!"
818,Justin ,2021,5,My family will love this console very pleased with purchase
819,Audrey Moritz,2021,5,"Extremely fast, great graphics,no complaints!"
820,Loni P.,2021,5,I randomly looked up the ps5 and it happened to have dropped at 12am. I guess people didn't realize it either because they were available for purchase for a good 30min.Received the item real fast and everything came as advertised. Definitely worth buying at its normal price not the one people are taking advantage of.Really wish these were released in a better fashion since BOTS are being used to buy everything before anyone can buy it. There should be some kind of regulation everywhere.Product is awesome and everyone deserves to be able purchase this and not sell out instantly.
821,good work,2021,5,This is my 4th playstation console. All have been reliable and worked for years without issues. Graphics are awesome. Boot up is quick. Game loading is basically instantaneous. The only surprise was the size. This console is quite large. It's as big as my stereo reciever.
822,G space,2021,5,"Thankyou Amazon, had been trying to get my hands on one since they came out. I love it, shipping was fast and secure."
823,Clinton G Wendorf,2021,2,The graphics seem similar to ps4 for all the hype.
824,EliteRundas,2021,5,Not much to say other than much love to PlayStation. Awesome Console!
825,Millenia,2021,5,Was finally able to get my hands on one of these consoles after trying for a while. Much larger than the PS4 but performance is better and the added quality in the games makes the upgrade worth it.
826,SUnny,2021,5,"Fast, great graphics, quality product. Liked it so much, worth the money and wait. Thank you amazon"
827,Jay,2021,5,Delivery was on time! Product is perfect. My husband is elated 😊
828,Brandon Thompson,2021,5,"Fast delivery, excellent game console at the original price. Highly recommend as the next main Sony Game Console."
829,Dennis Shaw,2021,5,This is honestly the best new console out. I know its hard to get one but its so worth it. Amazing and fantastic
830,Aaron,2021,5,My son loves it. Not had one single issue with it since unboxing.
831,Sergio,2021,5,It was worth the rent
832,Cheyenne K.,2021,5,"Crazy fast! Looks incredible in person, definitely a show piece. Worth the wait!"
833,Mo Q,2021,5,"Was able to score on May 26th drop surpassed the dogs and all the bots and scored right when dropped. 2 minutes in and sold out was able to confirm it. Best console ever made, alongside PS4 Backwards Compatible via disc version (3,000+ Games) Playable makes it the best of both generations. Enjoy."
834,Brendan Lamacchia,2021,5,Really good quality and good graphics
835,Dojo,2021,5,I bought it for the original price when it briefly restocked and it was worth it
836,justin,2021,5,Cant believe I was able to land this on Amazon. Obsessed 🤩
837,Shadow,2021,5,"After almost a year after buying the ps5 for retail price (500 disc version) it's been great. The fan isn't near as loud as the ps4, it's still noticeable but nowhere near as the ps4. If you have headphones you'd wouldn't be able to notice. The ps5 does deliver on the upgraded load time. The controller alone is amazing with the rumble and adaptive triggers. There are some games that uses the controller to its full extent such as Astros playroom game, and the new rachet and clank. You can feel every foot step you take. Not to mention the power of the guns in rainbow six and other fps games. It's been a really great product, I just wish the whole launch would've gone better. Everyone online was suggesting a queue system and allowing only people to buy once. It could've gone alone smoother. Ps5 itself I've had no problems with at all despite a lot of people online saying things about the rest mode an etc which since then has been fixed. I give it 5/5 however launch a 1/5 stars."
838,Triston wright,2021,5,Shipping took longer than expected but other than that part. Works like a charm. Before you buy: the tiny microscopic shapes on the back of the controller catch residue sometimes so it ends up leaving your controller dirty luckily soap should get it out but be careful.
839,no,2021,1,Console keeps crashing alot of of crashes special on cyberpunk 2077 is unplayable alot of people complaining that gpu is over heating
840,JEFFERY HUMPHREY,2021,5,Great!!
841,Alexa Salazar,2021,5,"I love that a lot of the games that are pretty recent on the PS4 have already been upgraded to run better on the PS5. Final Fantasy VII Intergrade came out yesterday and it runs beautifully, the loading times are minimal. It’s a fast console with some pretty neat exclusives that are coming/came out close to the launch date."
842,Susu Chan,2021,5,I love this ps5. Nice and cool. I love playing with my friends.
843,Jason,2021,5,"The PS5 is a nice machine.  Games optimized for it look great, the Dualsense controller is really cool, and the SSD is super fast!  SSD is smaller than I want, but I knew that going in.  They provide an easy way to expand that with an expansion bay that is easy to access and compatible drives should be announced this summer."
844,Walter Feliciano,2021,5,Awesome game play and graphics
845,Douglas H.,2021,5,Awesome load times and the graphics are flawless
846,Douglas L,2021,5,Great deal
847,Maul Scarreign,2021,5,"I love this. UI is clean and smooth.. night and day compared to PS4's laggy disaster of a UI. I just wish it had more storage and the controller had a longer battery life. There's a lack of transparency with the ""Other"" part of the Storage section where it just says it's for apps and games to work properly. The number goes up randomly and I never know why. Also, as of right now, you can't customize the PS5 UI but I assume that'll be fixed in future updates."
848,DaOrgest,2021,5,"With it's fast loading times, and supported ps4 games, it's a beast. But the ps5 games are very limited at this time, but all of them are looking next gen and I can't wait!"
849,Spectra,2021,5,I got one that's all that matters 😌
850,Emmanuel,2021,5,"Huge upgrade from the ps4 its not even close, happy to see how good the new PlayStation and xbox are"
851,Nicolas C.,2021,5,Best console ever! Although the controller is a little bigger than previous versions
852,Jean Paul Araya Meléndez,2021,5,The console is a work of art. Very stylish and futuristic. It is very silent and efficient. The most important thing is the interface and the catalog of games: masterpieces. It's a wonderful console and must for every gamer and PlayStation fan. 10/10.
853,Jim W.,2021,5,To be honest I was surprised I was able to purchase unit.  But with all the rush I didn't select extended warranty.  I reached back out that same day and they said they could not add it.  I'm a bit concerned if I have issues with unit.  But thanks for having the product.
854,Fabrizio,2021,5,"Buy it with AmazonGlobal and arrive in perfect condition, love it"
855,Jay Patel,2021,3,"The console is mid at most, not really as great as people hyped it up to be. Too bad I fell into the hype and purchased one, I wouldn't recommend it."
856,Daniel Lopez,2021,5,Really loved it.
857,Karen,2021,5,Great product. The visuals are awesome. Love this game system
858,Deya Ammar,2021,5,"I’ve owned PlayStations since the very first one, and each time there’s been a killer app that’s made the console worth owning within 6-9 months. It’s been nearly a year since the launch of the PS5 and we have yet to have any games on the console that justify the price tag of the machine, and that’s just as MSRP! I couldn’t imagine shelling out more than $500 for one of these things, what the heck are you going to play on it?Save your money until this chip shortage is over, hopefully by 2022. There will be plenty of games, like Horizon or God of War: Ragnarok, that will justify buying a PS5. Until then, PC/Switch is the legendary setup."
859,Ankit Hriday,2021,5,Arrived on time. Works as expected!
860,N. Burkhardt-Goode,2021,5,"Delivery right away and works great!  It was impossible to get other ways,  so this definitely worked for me."
861,Bharath,2021,5,Absolutely love the product. U can’t hate PS5
862,Rachel,2021,5,"can't use a Xbox 360 controller but other than that, its pog"
863,Kim,2021,4,"I finally was able to get one of these for retail price and so far, it's holding up very well. Love the performance and design. If you can get one for a decent price, I recommend you to get it!"
864,Sathya R.,2021,5,Worth the hype. Waiting for more native games to be available
865,Matthew Smith,2021,1,I’m sure I would like it if I had the item but I don’t.
866,Kindle Customer,2021,5,It was really expensive but well worth it. I got it for my son for his 10th birthday and he loves it!
867,A. Bush,2021,5,"I own both the PS5 and Xbox X. They're both great machines but the PlayStation wins hands down for one reason, and one reason only. The controllers are light years better imo. When you game for hours on end controller design can make or break a system. Imo Xbox is a slightly better system overall, just can't get used to the chunky controllers."
868,P. Ferdinand,2021,5,"I finally got one! A very happy day! Works fine so far. Fan is kind of noisy sometimes, which is alarming, but I guess that's normal. I don't like the new UI of the PS5. I miss the customizable PS4 home screen where you could see what your friends were doing. But anyway, this giant refrigerator now sits in a place of honor on my TV stand. lol"
869,Andrew Valentino,2021,5,"Absolutely great console, had a lot of fun, glad I was able to get it!"
870,chef,2021,5,Works a described lol
871,Deja,2021,5,My son loves this. It came exactly how it was described brand new in box
872,Harold herrera,2021,5,Lo mejor de lo mejor
873,Virginia,2021,5,Great console great games first time ever I get a PlayStation before an Xbox (I own both) but me and the wife game on PlayStation and this generation really improved from last
874,SD Lonyer,2021,5,"I'm sorry everyone doesn't have a ps5,it's amazing. I'm empressed with everything. It's pretty much idiot proof to bring your ps4 game 's over. It's everything u want in a gaming system. Also the controller is awesome it's like it's made for my hands and responds so much faster.. Good luck everyone."
875,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Finally got a Amazon drop for the PlayStation 5. Works great,  delivery was on time and thank you.  Will order another one for my son"
876,Maaz Chester,2021,3,"I was expecting more, after reading all the hype about the PS5. Getting one was like winning a competition, so I was super excited to get one. While I can see the difference between this and my PS4 Pro, the difference is not night and day. I was thinking of getting rid of my gaming PC and using the PS5 only, but it doesn't look like that will be the case anymore."
877,justin campbell,2021,5,"Just had to wait for the price to drop to a reasonable price of just over 500 dollars, best purchase I've made to date. Highly recommend and advise future buyers to not pay scalpers or more than retail price"
878,SuSeQ,2021,5,It's the best gaming deal out right now if you can get one. You can't even get a video card for a gaming PC this good at this price point. It takes a little planning and luck but you can do it. Amazon seems to be the most fair and easiest way to get one during a stock drop at the moment. Don't give in to the scalpers!!! When the dust settles they'll be forced to sell them at or even below cost.
879,TenmaRezP1X,2021,5,Finally after all this time. To anyone reading this. Twitter is your best friend if you want this. Best of Luck and Keep at it. Cause it took me about 2 weeks of BS to get this bad boy.
880,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I GOT THIS. Everything runs great! No issues yet!! Sucks most of the system storage is full, but an external hard drive is definitely gonna be needed! Otherwise this thing is beautiful. Cannot be more happy!!"
881,Cody Gray,2021,5,Best purchase I’ve made in a long time.
882,Atishay Narayanan,2021,5,"So glad I was able to purchase. I have been trying to get one for so long, and amazon finally came through. I am so excited that I can finally playing on this next-generation console."
883,Chelsea Njoku,2021,4,It’s amazing but I’m always lagging on games and sadly have to purchase a new wifi box because I couldn’t even play an online game without lagging and had never had this problem with the 4 years I had my ps4.
884,Sarah,2021,5,Fiancé plays it 24/7 so guess it’s worth the money
885,AjRosado,2021,5,Fast shipping and the PS5 is amazing. Thank you so much!!!
886,Dobby,2021,5,4k 60fps is not a dream
887,Blade Wolfhart,2021,5,"I can't believe I finally got one. I have been playing it scenes it got delivered. I like how fast the PS5 is and the fact that it has haptic feed back in the controller and HD Rumble. The only downside for now is the found interface where the games are, it fells light and I don't like the I have to press the PS button to get to notification and the power off\ rest mode settings."
888,Qi Zong Liang,2021,5,Good console very valuable and super useful!
889,Komla Ndanou,2021,5,"Works Great,Quiet..Best console 2020"
890,Elderim,2021,5,half a year in still working as should and no problem soo far.
891,Frankie Orona,2021,5,"Very amazing console, worth every penny if you're able to get for MSRP. I do understand that there are some issues with some systems. Mostly do to software issues and will be dealt with as patches come along. I do recommend picking up a console within the next year or so but at the moment there is no rush. Good luck for those of you still trying to get your hands on one."
892,Amazon Customer,2021,5,good
893,Tony,2021,5,It is what it is not much else to say about it.
894,Daniel,2021,5,"Proud owner of a the next gen console, PlayStation 5. I wished it was more available to purchase than sold out. I had great luck to order the ps5 when it came instock online. I was patiently waiting to get the shipping confirmation and pray that it arrived safe and sound. The shipping box was damage on the top folding flapps, but the PlayStation box itself was okay. It is a heavy console weighing at around 9 lbs or 4.45 kg. It is the tallest console in vertical position compare to the xbox series x. I am please with how the console looks and especially the newer redesigned dualsense controller. I find out that it also has a M.2 expansion slot to further allow more ssd storage for the PlayStation 5, which will come in a further update this coming summer. Safe to say, i am liking the new features and details on the PS5. With the new uhd blu-ray disc drive finally in this next gen console, makes it even better for the price, and also further your use of the next gen console. In my opinion it looks much better in the vertical position, some like it in horizontal position. Performance wise is pretty fast, not sure how Sony did it, but they did. This is a great next gen console and can't wait for great games to come.  Overall, it arrived safe, i have yet to play any games on it. But i am liking the new design and will have it stand next to my 4k hdr tv. This is a great console and sony took it to the next level in terms of design and power."
895,JARMON MOORE,2021,5,"Can’t believe I actually got this at 2am. So glad i did Tho. Can’t get enough of it. Already got more games, another controller and PS5 headset. Love the adaptive feel on the controller."
896,Katie Weisenburger,2021,5,"I somehow managed to check Amazon when they restocked the PS5. With taxes and shipping it came to $553. So far graphics are excellent and it was easy to transfer my PS4 data to it. It walked me though the entire process. A tip is to NOT turn off or disconnect your PS4 even when it says transfer complete. You still have to download each game individually and it messes it up if you have already turned it off. So far very happy with purchase.To purchase console on Amazon. MAKE SURE YOU ARE SIGNED IN AND HAVE PAYMENT/SHIPPING INFORMATION READY TO GO. Continue to click ""Add to Cart"" despite it saying ""Out of Stock"". This is untrue. Keep refreshing and adding to cart. This should be the four steps. 1. Add to Cart 2. Shipping Options 3. Review Order 4. Place Order.Hope this helps :) x"
897,tmarcus,2021,5,The best
898,Leonardo D.,2021,5,I bought this for my brother it works amazing 120 FPS is so much better than 60 FPS my brother tells me he says it’s such a good product and he gives it a 5 star for it
899,Richard,2021,4,"Some people like the design of the console, others don't. I'm pretty sure the people that don't like it have interiors and decor in their home that don't really match the aesthetic of the console. I'm lucky to have a certain style that already matches the PS5 and exemplifies that a nice design it has. The design tends to belong in a more upscale environment since pairing it with brown wood and brown everything leaves it sticking out like a sore thumb. It belongs in the same kind of architecture Zaha Hadid completed before she died. What I will say is that the packaging by the big A themselves left much to be desired, but that disappointment is another story for another day. The PS5 runs nice, quiet and cool. I managed to snag this one in a 10 minute window and I was very lucky"
900,Dominique Tate,2021,5,Came on time  as expected.
901,Babak,2021,1,"Disappointed with customer service. Anytime I put it in rest mode, it will keep crashing after it wakes up. I sent it to PlayStation support repair center which took almost a month to receive it back. Took it out of box and it has lots of scratches along with 2 deep scratches on black surface."
902,Jonathan Wang,2021,3,"I was just barely able to get mine and could only get it because I was notified on Twitter that it was coming back in stock. Having it in hand, the ps5 is actually pretty nice. I can't deny that the performance is simply just years ahead of the ps4. The difference is really noticeable especially playing fps games and hdr games with 4k resolutions. But because of its availability, I'm going to have to take off 2 stars."
903,Jesus,2021,5,"I took me a while to get one but oh boy this is soo worth it. The quality of the games is superb , everything loads quick and the interface is smooth. People don't talk a lot about the controller but I believe is the most innovate it thing about the ps5. The adaptive trigger technology redefines first person shooters ."
904,Aaron,2021,5,I have been a PlayStation fan since PlayStation 1 and when they say there's no limits there's really is no limits and when I'm not playing games the 4K Blu-ray player works excellent
905,LS 33 wraith,2021,5,Love the fact i got one hate how amazon supports scalpingI do wish the memory was more and the feed back controls are ok but probably not like ya think.
906,Jamieson O'Marr,2021,5,"Great upgrade over my OG PS4, time will tell if the hype over the new controllers will match up with the improved processing power and new games coming out, but it’s off to a good start. If you can snag one, you won’t be disappointed!"
907,M.,2021,5,Good delivery and great product.
908,CK310,2021,5,I’ve been trying for months to get one of these..thanks to Amazon I finally got my hands on one!
909,Britney kimminau,2021,5,I absolutely love my ps5 im currently playing resident evil on it and i absolutely love it! It also servers as a media center hub as well you can watch Netflix and YouTube tv on it with no problems as well as blueray movies! If you are lucky enough to get your hands on one you know how awesome they are!
910,Hunnidstacks,2021,5,It worked amazing.
911,Ruan,2021,5,This console is in another level!
912,Jory Tangalin,2021,5,Thank you thank you Amazon for this purchase! Made my year!
913,Keron,2021,5,Great 👍🏿👌🏾
914,Talia Wolkoff,2021,5,My boyfriend is so happy! Thank gosh I got it on here instead of paying an arm and leg Lol
915,Myke and Kelly,2021,5,"Got lucky and ordered, showed up on time NO issues (thankfully)"
916,IP,2021,5,Finally was able to get a hold of one. Just at the right place at the right time. This console is 100% worth every cent. Exceeds my expectations. Definitely an upgrade from an Xbox One haha
917,Jason Palmer,2021,5,"This is an absolutely fun product to own. The specs in comparison to my previous consoles are no where near this playstation 5. I play it with my friends frequently, and it's a great console to play to kill time. I highly recommend to anyone who has thought of buying a PS5."
918,Bobby Lee,2021,5,"Great games, great graphics and especially great controller.  There is a lot of innovation with the PS5 and sure it can't compete with PC games, however there is a comfort factor that I appreciate.  I am also a PC gamer with a 3080 graphics card.  The only games i enjoy playing on PC are 1st person Shooters."
919,B. Ablia,2021,5,"What I like about it? The ability to play PS4 titles while waiting for more must have PS5 titles to become available. The UI is definitely an improvement over PS4 UI but still feels a little lacking in some parts but then again the console is a work in progress.I got lucky and got this unit at retail price when Amazon dropped the shipment, took me awhile but in no way was I ever going to buy this unit for more than the $499 retail price. Tip for those looking and what I had ending up doing was following people like mattswider or jake_randall_yt on twitter with notifications turned on as they do give announcements from time to time on retail drops that are occurring, and you just have to be plain out persistent on getting one.What I use it for? Playing games but since I had acquired a 4k hdr tv less than a year ago the Playstation 5 has let me take full advantage of what my tv offer's whether it be games at 4k HDR or 4k uhd movies on disc or streaming, it's a nice addition for multimedia entertainment."
920,Fernando Bravo,2021,5,Works great!
921,katia,2021,5,"amazing graphics and games, controller is actually comfortable, arrived pretty quick too which was cool"
922,Marcelo,2021,5,Nice console
923,AcemanWolf,2021,5,"Finally got one from Amazon. Best console out in the market. When this console is back in stock, I recommend getting it."
924,Jaydine Lee,2021,5,"So far, so great!!! We recieved it within 36 hours of purchasing, possibly less.My boyfriend is super stoked!I immediately started playing the game that comes on the console, Astro's Playroom. It's cute and all the collectibles are previous Playstation products and accessories. It was fun. He has Assassins Creeed: Valhalla from Playstation 4 and was able to upgrade the software,  for free, to PS5. He purchased the remade-for-PS5 game Demon's Souls and we have been fully entranced by it for week, now."
925,Jay,2021,5,"PlayStation 5 demand has been off the chart, while production and supply is low , it seems almost impossible to buy one. After months of trying I was finally able to purchase one , and here is some tips and product review , first know when they will release , I used  to ask multiple customer service representatives weekly about when will be the next restock , sometime you will know . How to buy ? When it went live . You really need to be fast , add to cart. And get it paid as soon as you can ( set up default payment and shipping method ) then after that you will likely see product has gone out of stock error …… keep refresh that page it will go back in stock and pay when you see it in stock . Overall PlayStation 5 has never  let me down , the DualShock control and the quality of pixel , it’s life changing , I’m so glad that they are launching GTA V in November for PS5 platform, the white color on the console is nice but I would prefer if I could get an black edition 🤫 anyway , hope all of you secure one soon ."
926,RedArmyLLC,2021,5,"fantastic speed and layout, but way way tall."
927,Franklin Cruz,2021,5,Simply Amazing.
928,damon harris,2021,5,"I paid a premium for this, but I am completely happy with the purchase. The system came and my kids are loving it. We are happy that we could get the system."
929,Jabaree,2021,5,The greatest console ever made...so far...
930,Rubisely Betancourt,2021,5,Perfect
931,Paco,2021,3,"I purchased this console at launch, and was lucky enough to get the Series X shortly after it launched. The PS5 is a fantastic piece of hardware; however, it has almost been a year and Sony still doesn't offer an internal storage solution. Microsoft offers storage, albeit at a premium, so it's absurd that Sony struggles to figure out what hard drives are compatible and provide a list to consumers. Less than 1TB of storage is completely unacceptable when 60-100GB games is the norm. I love the system, but I'm only using it to play Sony exclusives from here on. When a title is available for both consoles, I purchase it for X Box."
932,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Wanted to upgrade from the PS4 Pro. Everything is much faster. Games look better, load better and feel better with the Dualsense. I haven't had any issues yet but if I do I'll update."
933,Varun Jayendran,2021,5,The best console there is so glad to have got one!
934,Emmanuel Norris,2021,5,"Yes, it’s difficult to get. I’m here to encourage you. Don’t give in to scalpers. Just keep trying. Your day will come. Seriously. You’ll be so happy with yourself if you stick with it and persevere for retail price.With that out of the way, the system is amazing. Just not having load times for PS4 games is worth it for me. One thing I don’t like is that it’s so big. Takes up way too much room.  Also, new UI is trash. Not intuitive at all. I’m constantly Googling how to do simple stuff since it’s not obvious. Just looking at trophies is a pain."
935,Amazon Customer,2021,5,It’s wonderful! Great graphics and some PS4 games updated to 60 FPS!
936,Hunter Meredith,2021,5,"Hard to get but definitely worth it. While most of the games I’m playing were on the PS4 and just updated, they really do look amazing and play much smoother on the PS5"
937,alex,2021,4,"A lot of games support 4k 60 fps which is excellent and the quality of the PS5 in general is great. Look premium, feels premium, the controller feels absolutely fantastic to the point that its my favorite controller, the UI isn't an ugly mess like the PS4 one. My problems with it so far is voice chat ONLY comes out of the controller if there's no headset plugged in with no way to change it. I don't know why this decision was made but oh well. For those with a high end set up, the console doesn't support HDR10+ (tho it seems like nothing ever will either), Dolby Vision or Dolby Atmos. Another problem is optical cable output, it doesn't support it. What's worse is if you connect it thru your TV, there WILL be audio lag. So if you're using a soundbar/sound system, be prepared to switch to ARC HDMI, AV Output or buy a converter for optical to ARC. Oh and the final big thing is storage size. it's about 600 gigs, completely unacceptable in these days when most games hit over 50 gigs. If you're a Warzone player, have fun with 150 gigs, 200 gigs if you want the 4K texture packs. You can use an external HDD/SSD but PS5 games will NOT work them. PS5 DOES have a PCIe slot for the new age storage, I don't have one but I know that there's no support for it yet."
938,Sean1225,2021,5,Better game experience than 4
939,Joker,2021,5,It must suck to be you
940,Lokesh Sai Vattikuti,2021,5,I really love playing on PS5 the best experience ever.
941,Jesús Luis Martínez,2021,5,Buena
942,Tyler,2021,4,"Load times are nonexistent. You press the button to start, and you’re in the game! Even massive improvements to PS4 games. 4K is stunning and so is 60 FPS. Ray tracing is a huge game changer! So why 4 stars? Points off for Design and Packaging.  I want a BLACK CONSOLE. Also the stand is wonky when you lay the system on its side. Also, I can’t believe there was no protective film over the glossy black middle.In summary, PS5 is fire and Black Consoles Matter!"
943,Javier,2021,2,Si desea compra un prodruto te restrinje por la ubicacion demografica no deberia ser hasi.
944,Connor,2021,5,Beautiful console at a great price. To anyone complaining about price realize this item sells so fast and the prices above $500 are individual sellers that are selling through Amazon website that isn't Amazon themselves! Was worth the wait and process to get in my opinion and have spent a lot of free time on mine!
945,Yamani Green,2021,5,Man I love this damn game
946,gotlove4Ubaby,2021,5,Great gift!
947,John T.,2021,5,Amazon blessed me with this console. I’m so happy
948,Nick DiBene,2021,5,great
949,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Fun to play but not many exclusive games yet. I will say if you haven’t gotten one yet you aren’t missing out I promise you.
950,Cory Pratt,2021,5,Awesome
951,Christian Moreno,2021,5,Sold it and made money 100 percent recommend
952,Zach,2021,5,"Worth the money, great exclusives, very fast experience, I love it everyday"
953,CrownofKings,2021,2,The reason I gave 2 stars is that I didn’t receive my package on time. Which I did pay for faster shipping. The console I received was faulty and I had to send it to Sony. Crashes from Home Screen were constant. But from what games I could attempt to play was fun.
954,louis,2021,5,PS5 lifeee
955,RAUL O.,2021,1,I wanted one at first but now i don't care. Im not paying those ridiculous prices. I'll do what i did with ps4 wanted till prices went down to half price my patience skills are omega god tier....lol
956,Amazon Customer,2021,5,PS5 is as advertised! Easy setup and very enjoyable. Wish others can start to get one given the chip shortage.
957,Cody James,2021,5,"Amazing console, extremely fast load times. How the hell did I make the cut to get one lmao"
958,Chris,2021,5,Everything is perfect 👌
959,Jorge Montano Torres,2021,5,Words can’t describe how beautiful it looks and how smooth it operates. It’s simply one of the great wonders of the world.
960,Reymond Ortiz,2021,4,"So as good as specs and a controller goes, there is no wrong. But how hard it is to get your hands in one of these is not worth the effort."
961,Mamadou,2021,5,"PlayStation 5 is beyond my expectations. Fast loading games, remote play, haptic feedback, adaptive triggers. Huge library of PS5 games and unbelievable graphics, this product is awesome!"
962,Ray G,2021,5,I’m just giving 5 stars because I can’t believe I didn’t have to pay 2x the price for this console
963,musa,2021,5,Best delivery ever
964,Eva,2021,5,slaps.
965,Nida Dillard,2021,5,Worked great graphics are awesome
966,Conor Powell,2021,5,Good device but I need another for my brother
967,Amazon Customer,2021,5,The packages was delivered faster  than expected and the system lives up to the hype. Great purchase.
968,Nicolas Machado,2021,5,It’s worth the wait....
969,Robert J. Hernandez,2021,5,Great product and shipping was fast
970,Devin Dionne,2021,1,"PlayStation has the absolute WORST customer service I know. Do NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS JUST GET AN XBOX. They will not issue you refunds even if it falls within the policy written out ON PLAYSTATION.COM. Not to mention the lack of games, awfully loud disc drive, terrible navigation in the gamebase/party screen, and the fact that my controller damn near cracked from trying to get a better grip on it (y’all know what I’m talking about, when you like shove it into your palm, we all do it) it’s not worth it."
971,Assad Adam,2021,5,Beautiful product
972,Andre M.,2021,5,Use stockx app to get a higher chance. Twitter users take too long posting when they go live.
973,John Rosarda,2021,5,"The console is very nice. Works well. No issues. Amazon delivered in less than 48 hours from when I purchased and ordered my PS5, I was very impressed and satisfied with that haha"
974,Says Shé...,2021,5,"I got a PS5 day one . You get 20 games with Ps plus day one , Horizon, Persona5 , Fallout, God of War , Monster Hunter World and 15 more . The games are beautiful, SpiderMan and Demons Especially . The controller is amazing , I love the trigger and speaker in it and haptics give some cool senses. Rain drops in a game feel like tony drops on the controller , footsteps to your right or left with 3D sound is amazing . (Use a headset) Returnal is an awesome game , difficult but very fun. Demons Souls is one of my favorite games all time .Ratchet and Clank and Horizon Forbidden West are coming soon. Loading is so super fast it’s insane .  Don’t buy from scalpers obviously , you only support bad business. The pandemic unfortunately caused chip supply issues in every industry so supply is not Sony’s or anyone else’s fault . Factories were working at low volume as not enough workers were not there and cars , phones , consoles , PCs all have chip shortages . Just keep trying as stores stock PS5 every week. All my friends got theirs it just took a little effort . It’s totally worth it as Sony delivers great games and already has. You don’t get any new games on series X just keep your old Xbox it has the same games it was a total waste of money ."
975,James M clark,2021,1,And it's gone!
976,Bryan Matheny,2021,1,Absolutely trash that almost a year later and you still can’t buy a PS5 without getting scalped for thousands of dollars. I’m already over it and switched to pc. The console war is dead and y’all did it to yourselfs!
977,G.Spinosi,2021,5,"While there aren't many PS5 exclusive or ""native"" games as of yet, this is more an investment for future games. That said, playing some PS4 games on PS5 is a transformative experience, and the few exclusive / ""native"" PS5 games look and play great, while also loading incredibly fast. Very happy with the purchase....also very aware of how lucky I was to snag one. Hopefully the current chip shortage is resolved soon so more consumers can get their hands on one."
978,Alexander G.,2021,1,"interesting. Smb in Sony counting money? Allowing scalpers to buy all consoles, and let them just sit  in their hands. Just imagine how much money gamers are spending for accessories and actually games."
979,Nella schell,2021,5,A+
980,Jude Anthony Martinez,2021,5,100% love it
981,Drew,2021,5,The best console Sony has ever made. The DualSense controller is a game-changer and an amazing addition.
982,Joel t,2021,1,Play has no limits except for actually purchasing it
983,Robert c,2021,5,Got here super fast great packaging and everything functioned as should love it!!!
984,cali_kush70,2021,5,"The PlayStation 5 is absolutely SUPERB in ALL aspects of gaming. it is a Worthy successor to the phenomenal PS4/PS4 pro console in EVERY single way! the first thing you will notice right off the bat is how FAST the console is, from the user interface to playing games waiting is a thing of the past! the PS5 is the fastest games console I've EVER experienced, it even outperforms my buddies PC setup with his SSD which REALLY took me by surprise! The biggest downfall to the PS5 is the storage situation, with 825GB SSD (only 667GB is usable) Modern Warfare & Warzone alone account for almost 200GB. As of April 2021 you can now store & play ALL PS4 games from an external drive which is awesome! you can now store PS5 games on the external drive as well but you can NOT play PS5 games that are stored in the external drive you would have to transfer it back to the PS5 SSD in order to play PS5 games. Speaking of games, the PS5 doesn't disappoint when it comes to games! let me start by saying every PS4 games I've played loads faster & performs BETTER than the PS4 pro did. When it comes to PS5 games they're simply amazing! The Dual Sense controller is the MOST innovative feature rich controller I've EVER used! the haptics are brilliantly implemented & the adaptive triggers make games feel like every squeeze of the trigger matters. My PS5 games library consists of Astro's Playroom (the BEST pack in game since Wii sports) Black ops cold war, Mile Morales, Fortnite, Rogue Company & Genshin impact. Astro's Playroom is a fantastic platform that acts as a showcase for the new Dual Sense controller providing a fun game that shows exactly how amazing the controller truly is! Black ops cold war is decent, the load times are great but it's not next level when it comes to gameplay. Miles Morales on the other hand is next level, it's absolutely gorgeous running at 4K 60fps! it offers superb gameplay that's breathtaking showing a glimpse of what's possible on PS5! Fortnite is another game that's REALLY blown me away with it's PS5 upgrade! the game not ONLY loads so much faster compared to PS4 pro but it looks phenomenal in 4K at 60fps plus it's got improved textures & lighting & it's insane how much BETTER it is compared to the PS4 pro version! Rogue Company recently released their PS5 upgrade & it runs at a native 4K 60fps making for another beautiful free to play shooter on the PS5. Genshin impact is another amazing game that has gotten even BETTER with it's PS5 upgrade. load times are almost non existent & it's stunningly gorgeous!Final thoughts after 1 month: The PS5 has dethroned my PS4 pro as the BEST games console of ALL time imo! it plays my massive PS4 library with upgraded performance. It offers truly superb next level speed with it's SSD & the upgraded CPU / GPU along with 16GB of GDDR6 RAM make for an extremely powerful games console capable of games that we can't even fathom at the moment! I can't wait to see what the future holds for the PS5!I definitely recommend this console for anyone wanting the best playstation console ever made.PS5 tech specs:CPU: Custom 8-core AMD Zen 2,variable frequency, up to 3.5 GHzMemory: 16 GB GDDR6 SDRAM512 MB DDR4 RAM (for background tasks)Storage: Custom 825 GB SSDRemovable storageInternal (user upgradeable) NVMe M.2 SSD, or external USB-based HDDDisplay: Video output formatsHDMI: 720p, 1080i, 1080p, 4K UHD, 8K UHDGPU: Custom AMD RDNA 2,36 CUs @ variable frequency up to 2.23 GHzSound: Custom Tempest Engine 3D AudioDolby Atmos & DTS:X (Blu-Ray video & UHD Blu-Ray video) 7.1 surround soundController input: DualSense, DualShock 4, PlayStation MoveConnectivity: Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11axBluetooth 5.1Gigabit Ethernet2× USB 3.2 Gen 2×11× USB 2.01× USB-C with USB 3.2 Gen 2×11× HDMI 2.1Online services: PlayStation NetworkPlayStation Now"
985,Renaldo Bowen,2021,2,"The packaging wasn't the best as I only got one little small paper in a huge box to protect the console. Other than that, it's awesome"
986,Bob234,2021,5,I love the dual sense
987,Eulalia Cruz Casas SR,2021,5,Loved it
988,brett wardlaw,2021,4,"I was surprised I actually got one and it shipped overnight for me to receive next evening! PS5 is great, graphics and loading speeds are top notch! My only complaint is that sometimes the analog sticks are unresponsive when I turn on PS5 and I then have to reset console! This happens every other time I turn on system n is quite annoying!! Other than that I satisfied with purchase!!"
989,Trigga,2021,5,Actually got it!!! Was a random night when it released and gave it a go but it worked out whereas it was shipped to my address was another $400 to ship to the Bahamas but hey none the less Amazon had it stock price! Best system ever!
990,Antoine Brown,2021,4,"Love this console, it’s made a big improvement over the ps4. Faster loading times and the graphics are insane! My only complaint is the internal  memory is very low, so you have to buy a external hard drive if you want to hold more games."
991,Junior,2021,5,"Great Game Console its really fun , the controller is great with the Triggers !"
992,Wade Wilson,2021,4,Overheats like a MFr. It heats up the whole room till I'm sweating. You won't get the full capabilities of the console unless your TV can handle it by the way. It runs great but not a lot of games to play.
993,Brian,2021,5,Nice 👈🏼
994,Celetics35,2021,1,Worst rollout in history!!! Shame on you PlayStation! What a ripoff!!!
995,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"After months of trying to get it, I got one on last restock. Thank goodness I was sick and up at 4am. The ps5 runs extremely fast and hasn’t had any problems."
996,Josh,2021,4,"Very great system! Quite the hassle to get ahold of. It also has features that are well needed, like more storage, quick resume, and a dedicated backwards compatibility from the PS1 and up."
997,David Jimenez,2021,5,Love the new system.
998,Arun prasath,2021,5,The fact  that i own an PS5 right now is shock....for me...thanks amazon for the big drop and twitter trackers jake and matt.This is one true next gen console...love it
999,Mason,2021,5,Love it
1000,Michael T. Schefers,2021,5,"No bundle attached, no inflated price, and now it's mine."
1001,Burton Yuk Que,2021,5,This console takes you to a whole new level of gaming with its  immersive 4k resolution and loading speeds. I am 35+ and I was like a kid on Christmas. It was worth the wait and long hours monitoring PS5 restock. Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery and safe shipment.
1002,Claudia Ortiz,2021,5,Best experience
1003,sagar awasthi,2021,5,"Awesome console. Can't complain, new outlook from the playstation and performance is great."
1004,Scarebear,2021,1,"Unbelievable price hike, Amazon should ban scalpers and resellers. Restocks on here are gone in seconds, Amazon still not limiting purchases. Luckily people are fed up with scalpers and are not buying them at the absurd markups. I was lucky to snag an Xbox s from gamestop. Runs like a dream. I also bought a gaming laptop, and since steam carries most ps exclusive games, there's no longer a need for ps5. Plus my ps4 had hdmi problems from day 1. Cost me a couple hundred to fix and it ultimately stopped working all together. Never had any such issues with Xbox. I think I'm done with Sony."
1005,Aaron Garza,2021,5,Nice and smooth transaction
1006,Pete,2021,5,The console is a must have it has an amazing looking controller that feels perfect to hold the menu is really smooth and easy to navigate and the console itself has a beautiful design and it runs games beautifully
1007,Nathan Ancelet,2021,5,"I really wanted a PS5, but after a really long dump I decided to move to Hawaii. Best crap ever, thanks PlayStation."
1008,Hector Calderon,2021,5,Best Video game ever
1009,Chris Green,2021,5,A little more expensive than retail but it came within two weeks plus I absolutely love this game system. Best I've used for sure and I've been playing video games since the early 80s when all we had was pong and pacman.
1010,Hernan2242,2021,5,cop this was easy ngl
1011,Link jacques,2021,5,"The item came in perfect condition, and I’m honestly not disappointed... it was out the store new and it plays amazing"
1012,Takeo Suzuki,2021,3,"Great game collection, but an overall bad product. Controllers are built with paper, you'll get drift unless you're extra gentle. Does get louder than XSX. I've had a single System hard crash and a couple game crashes and I don't believe it's acceptable. At the end of the day I still recommend this for the amazing exclusives and the amazing haptic feedback on the new controller."
1013,Amazon Customer,2021,5,If you don't have one your poor hahaha
1014,Taylor-Anne Dumas,2021,1,On God I'm not paying more than $499 for a PS5. Enjoy having ten paperweights.
1015,Jan,2021,5,Great for gaming overall! As long as u can buy it...
1016,Officer penguin ,2021,5,It’s the pinnacle of gaming
1017,George M,2021,5,"After months of trying was able to get a ps5 for my boys, and also beat the boys.."
1018,Music Mode,2021,5,Happy as h*** on the restock. Needed it since my ps4 took a crap on me once again ...
1019,Is_The_Punisher PlayStation,2021,5,The best of all consoles and the best place to play video games
1020,Amazonian,2021,4,Bought this for my friend. They love it. I play my Xbox series X more.
1021,Ganesh Ramcharran,2021,1,"The PlayStation 5 was released to the public in November 2020. As of this moment, it has been 5 months since its release and people are still unable to purchase the console at its originally intended price. Sony has done a very poor job at restocking on these high-demand products, which results in the only way to attain one being to pay at least 2x the original amount, with many online listings being up to even $2,000. At this point, it's better to just wait for the next console or switch over to an XBOX Series X."
1022,Oscar Wilbon,2021,1,What they are doing is having the bots disrupt the site then buying all the units themselves. They do the same to all sites. Why don’t they something about this.
1023,Daniel Ramirez,2021,5,🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀👍👍👍👍
1024,Rich,2021,5,"I got it finally , thanks to Amazon. Regular price. Thank you. It’s pretty awesome:)"
1025,ro-no,2021,5,Just wanted to get a console for 5 months. Finally grabbed one on Amazon.
1026,Lupeq661,2021,5,"Upgraded from a Ps4 to a Ps5. This machine is quiet and everything you would expect from this new gem console. Fast, quiet, and amazing quality graphics"
1027,R. Wesley Pinkston,2021,5,"Runs games near perfectly! If you can snag one for retail price, you should consider it!"
1028,Melanie Dinger,2021,5,Works great my fiancé loves it
1029,Kindle Customer,2021,5,"Sony needs to get more out there, it's stupid how much crap i had to do to finally get one. It's like they didin't want my money :)"
1030,Amazon Customer,2021,1,worst console release in history 6 months and still nothing. poor planing and am attempt to short the market.
1031,Jesse Hawkins,2021,1,It stopped working after a week or so. And I don't use it that often.
1032,Luis,2021,4,"Not much to say, it is a ps5 and works as intended, not much complaints but just a friendly tip: don't leave this in rest/sleep mode over long periods of time because it will get fried. Mine was fried and upon talking to a sony representative I was told ""this is normal"" and is a bug currently."
1033,Chhumlong Phin,2021,4,"After waiting months, I finally was able to secure a PS5 for my son. He's ecstatic about it and it has been a long time since a new generation console was released so we had to try this one out. Our first impressions were how sleek and clean the console looked. It was a bit bigger than I would have expected but it still fits on his gaming desk with ease. What was also a huge upgrade from previous consoles was how crisp and clear the graphics were. I love how it is backwards compatible so he is able to use his older playstation as not many games have been released for the next gen. The load times are significantly faster than his playstation which is great. He is able to turn the console on and be playing within 3 minutes. The dual sense controller feels nice and is a decent size for all game genres. Overall, a very sold console, my son uses this almost daily."
1034,Arvind Searwar,2021,5,Love this thing. Super fast. can save footage with just 2 buttons. Cannot wait for more features over the years!!
1035,Brian,2021,5,Works better than expected based on reviews. The seller made sure to have the PS5 to me prior to the initial delivery date given by Amazon which made me a very happy man today.
1036,Liz,2021,4,I thorough enjoy playing my PS5. The graphics are amazing on my 4K TV. I like that I can play games that I enjoyed via disc on my PS4. The new controllers feel great as well. My main issue with this console is Sony's inability to make enough of these to consumers. I have been trying for months to acquire one.
1037,Boi,2021,5,"I’m an Xbox player but the PS5 is still a nice console, luckily I was able to get them all on release day."
1038,Aren R.,2021,5,Works great!
1039,Manuel Isaac,2021,5,"La consola llegó en perfecto estado. Para mi ha sido un buen salto comparado con la generación anterior. El sistema de la consola va muy fluido, rápido y tienes las opciones más visibles para el usuario, por ejemplo, antes tenías que entrar a icono de mensajes y demoraba en cargar hasta ver el mensaje y responder, ahora puedes entrar directamente desde el menú pusaldo el botón de PS; o entrar a la tienda es más rápido, editar tu perfil, entre otras opciones.La estoy usando con un monitor ASUS 4k a 60Hz porque no necesito más Hz puesto que no me enfoco a juegos competitivos y va de lujo.A pesar del marketing la tengo en posición horizonal, porque veo que en la parte inferior tiene unas pequeñas salidas de aire.Recomendaría que cuando la puedan comprar lo hagan a la par de un cobertor, un protector para el mando por las manchas, si es necesario un cable HDMI compatible como los de Zeskit porque el que incluye es corto, por lo menos en mi setup y revisar bien la posición en la que van a ubicarla, no encerrarla en un mueble, sobre todo la parte trasera donde sale todo el aire, esta consola tiene buena entrada y salida de aire como para ponerla encerrada en un mueble de la sala o cuarto."
1040,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Unreal console
1041,hayden langelier,2021,5,"Amazing console and games, great deal for 500."
1042,David,2021,5,Love my ps5 thank you Amazon!
1043,LB,2021,1,"They went a long was trying to get the fan you not sound like a jet like the PS4 pro. But then cheap out completely on the power supply. Resulting in an obnoxious very audible buzzing sound. When ever you play any game that is designed for the PS5 and starts asking for more power. I don't know if this is wide spread, but it looks like it's not just a couple judging from a Google search about it.I sold mine, and I am going to wait it a bit (like I have a choice). Hopefully my next one doesn't have this issue."
1044,True,2021,3,Love the PlayStation the only reason I’m taking one star off is because the controller was glitching and when I tried to switch the controller they told me I had to send the entire system back like that’s not happening I’ve been waiting months to get it I refuse to send in the entire console just because the controller was defective I wish they just replace the controller for me
1045,Joshua Kraak,2021,5,Best console I’ve ever owned! I’m so excited to play Ratchet & Clank and I’m so lucky to have gotten my hands on one of these!!!
1046,ziad,2021,5,very good
1047,Isaac,2021,5,Love it
1048,Evan,2021,5,"Great new edition to the playstation family, its everything I want out of a console. . Thank you Amazon for keeping the scalpers and bots at bay long enough for me to get a PS5 finally. Now just help me get a rtx 3080 at close to msrp ;)"
1049,Mo,2021,5,Great product!
1050,Mo,2021,5,Great product!
1051,KC,2021,4,Fun to play not many great games out for it yet sadly.
1052,cade,2021,5,"If you can get one at retail price and you already have 4K TV, it’s worth getting."
1053,Coolie Bai,2021,5,Great purchase and quick delivery
1054,Devon Whitted,2021,5,Top tier
1055,Zachary Smith,2021,5,Ever since I’ve received my PlayStation I’ve played it virtually non stop. I love everything about it. Amazon was quick with delivery as it arrived before 5pm
1056,Shannon Peace,2021,5,Everyone needs this.
1057,wilfredo bermudez,2021,5,Best ever
1058,Maria Gomez,2021,5,I can't believe I was able to get my hands on this! I purchased this for my family living room for all the kids can play and they have a blast. I am looking forward to trying to purchase another one for a gift to give to my grandson.
1059,mrcmrc,2021,5,Good!!!
1060,josem,2021,5,Fantastic console with the best remote of this gen. Its a real shame not everyone can get their hands on it.
1061,Husam,2021,4,Great console and a cool design. I love the controller and the console itself. It’s a PS5 so obviously it will be great. Only issue is it’s loud when inserting disc.
1062,Walbert Matos,2021,5,"Has worked great so far with no issues. With all the recent firmware updates being stable none of the issues that were present for people on launch day are an issue anymore. So now it's a good time to get one... if you're able to find it in stock somewhere. Don't support scalpers or resellers, the elevated prices aren't really worth it. This is a 500$ console with of 500$ quality, paying more than that will just make you regret it."
1063,James Lawlor,2021,5,I got this in anticipation of Ragnarok and HZD2 but it's been a lot of fun so far. PS4 games look awesome on it.
1064,cody ray holliday,2021,5,this is innovation at its finnest! you can sync your ps4 and just play everything on this one. its like an upgrade into a new system instead of a stand alone start over new system.
1065,TheChildOfRage,2021,5,Received on my first attempt
1066,laneasha moore,2021,5,The product itself
1067,Jesse Altergott,2021,5,It’s a great system. Plays well. And the graphics are amazing. It’s a PlayStation. It sells itself
1068,Scott Wood,2021,4,Everything was what I expected in my order. Shipping went smooth as well. I only gave 4 star because of the price. I don't think anyone price gouging deserves a 5th star.
1069,Anthony russo,2021,5,Love it
1070,Amr Lotfy,2021,4,"Good console. However, not as expected in terms of graphics. Loading time and dual sense controller though are whats makes the experience better than older consoles."
1071,PnutShells,2021,5,Very good system to have. System arrived in 3 days and so far everything is good to go.
1072,Ivan Ortiz,2021,5,It's Beautiful I was waiting a long time for this thanks you and amazon staff man an really happy with it
1073,V. G. ,2021,5,"Great System. Faster than previous consoles. Hard to get, but it’s worth the price."
1074,Dawson K.,2021,5,"Fantastic console! SSD runs really smooth and quick. The adaptive triggers are really interesting and unique. I have both an Xbox series x and a PS5. This was my third playstation(PS2/PS4/PS5)and my 4th Xbox (Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox one, Xbox Series X). Xbox with the quick resume is an insane game changer, and Playstation having adaptive triggers and all the exclusives is insane. I wish both consoles would partner up and have all the features and no exclusives. Maybe then they could actually compete with PC, but I do love the PS5. I HIGHLY recommend it. I’m running it on the LG85 nano series at 4K 120hz. It’s gorgeous and if you’ve played Cold War on it then you’ll really understand the adaptive trigger feeling I love this console and the series X. If you can snag both 100% do!"
1075,victor,2021,5,"Please don't let anything get in the way of grabbing this console up. I love Playstation since the ps2 and this right here is the most awesome console ever. Fps is at a constant 60 (depending on game your playing, not all games at the moment play at that) Or high resolution 4k gaming. This thing is a beast internally and externally. It's bulky but i personally love it for the fact that it looks like a step towards future gaming and this console looks futuristic. All in all you'll love it from the games to the controller, the interface and just everything. Memory is a bad part but I don't worry since I have an external memory hard drive and in the future we can out our own memory slots in the console itself once provided. You'll love the speed the 4k graphics and the constant high frame rate. Don't listen to the people that say it's bad because it's really not it's the future of gaming"
1076,Candace ,2021,5,Bought this for my husband lol he was the happiest man on earth. He loves it!!
1077,Sh pranto,2021,5,Finally got it.
1078,ERØS,2021,5,Great product. Would recommend. As described. Unexpected surprise. Would buy again.
1079,Maritza C.,2021,1,"My first months with this console were amazing. The load times were fast, the dual sense felt amazing, and the console itself had a sleek design. However, just last week my console started crashing randomly whenever I would play a game. First, it would barely happen, then it would say rebuilding database. Now it won’t even power up, it just turns on, nothing but the fan, and then turns off. I tried turning it on in safe mode, and rebuild database like other people. But it would still crash halfway when rebuilding the database. I am deeply disappointed in this, I had to completely reset my entire console and redownload everything again. Edit: It turns out that the reset didn’t help at all. It just works for the first 2 hours and the same issue started happening again."
1080,Steph,2021,5,Can't day much numbers speak for themselvesBest console to day
1081,Aziz,2021,5,Perfect
1082,Shimi,2021,5,:D
1083,Amazon Customer,2021,1,first day I used it bricked now it just beeps but it won't turn on
1084,SAM,2021,5,It is so fun playing on this gaming system. Much better than PS4 in terms of quality and refresh rate. And the haptic feedback is pure amazing
1085,James,2021,5,I love it and it came alot quicker than I thought. Double the price but worth it instead of waiting till 2023
1086,Charles,2021,5,dubs big dubs
1087,Justin V.,2021,5,Love everything about this! I’ve been waiting patiently to make this purchase on Amazon and was glad I finally got the opportunity. Great buy and authentic too! Arrived within a few days.
1088,Kelvin,2021,4,"Could be better, hella lackluster"
1089,Zach bynes,2021,5,"I bought this ps5 as a gift for my girlfriend but she broke up with me before her birthday. It even came with a game, astrobot, so when I lost my job because I was devastated by my breakup, I was able to immediately jump into the action! My only complaint is after a long night of scream-crying and solo-love, the controller buttons can get sticky quickly! (Baby wipes!!!) if any of you guys are like really really sad, this is the console for you; if you’re content with life and are generally happy I cannot speak to your enjoyment but I can say I love Trina, if you come back Ill get rid of the games, I just want you!"
1090,shawanda,2021,5,It’s dope!
1091,Faysal Ibrahim,2021,5,Can’t go wrong with this thing! So beautiful and makes any game room pop! Love the design and very very fast compared to the last PlayStation console
1092,Paying Customer ,2021,4,The product arrived on time with now issues.  Nothing was damaged and everything works great.  Just wish the price would have been more reasonable.
1093,Erik Baran,2021,5,It’s in like flin! Love it!! Let the madness get started!
1094,Sonya,2021,5,"Finally got the console at a regular retail price! So far, I love it! I’ve been playing Spider-Man, love it. I’ve even really enjoyed the little robot game that comes pre-installed on the console. It’s so fun :) The controller is amazing - build-in mic, good sound quality for extra little sounds while you play, responsive buttons, comfortable. The Home Screen, in my opinion, is much better. A great improvement. I’ve also tested the streaming feature, it’s so much more convenient, functional, and appealing. I would definitely suggest this console to a friend!"
1095,Roger Morris,2021,5,"So far, the best gaming system I’ve ever played."
1096,Nicholas Diaz,2021,4,"The console is awesome, but there are a couple of issues. Regarding sound, any disc plays properly, but sound hiccups every now and then, briefly dropping out. It can be annoying. Also, the Dualsense 5 controllers have been notorious for joystick drift, and after 2 months mine was no exception. Keep your warranty info handy."
1097,Abdullah Almodares,2021,5,Hard to score one but I finally did and it is just amazing! Great quality and great content by Sony. I do somewhat like the exclusiveness that they have created around it as well. A very nice and well-made console that lives up to the expectations.
1098,Mike,2021,5,I got a ps5 finally thanks to Amazon :) happy :)
1099,Aimen,2021,5,"It's an amzing console by modern day standards for gaming and having fun as both a casual or an intense gamer, I do wish Sony adds more free games for its PS+ services in the near future so it could be on the same level as Xbox Game Pass which offers hundreds of free games, still it's an amzing piece of machinery."
1100,Cece! ,2021,4,The ps5 is cool. Glad I clicked the notification 1 minute after my app alerted me to Amazon. My only two issues are: 1. Right after I hit purchase I forgot to add insurance and it wouldn't allow me to. I literally just purchased the item not 2 minutes prior. 2. The system doesn't have enough hdmi ports so I had to purchase a splitter which will be here in the next 3 days🙄
1101,B-ryan SOD,2021,5,Really feels and looks like next gen! It’s literally DOUBLE the size of my ps4! Console and controller have some weight to them! Overall impressed.
1102,Miguel A.,2021,5,"Been trying to get the PS5 for months ever since its release! But unfortunately couldn’t get one due to being out of stock but then I was one of the lucky ones to finally get one. Man I was so excited and happy! When it finally arrived, I started connected it to my tv and start having fun with my PS5! I gotta say I love it so much and it’s so worth buying. 💯"
1103,Mario Hernandez,2021,4,"It’s a good console, I like the fact that it runs 4K 120 fps but it only has 660 GB of usable memory and Sony still hasn’t updated the firmware to expand with m2 ssd, also getting one was a pain in back but i think is best wait till they have enough stock and maybe when that happens there will be more games for the PS5 exclusively."
1104,Eduardo D Rodriguez,2021,5,Awesome product
1105,Nick ibrahim,2021,5,Very fun and keeps my kids busy
1106,Schwanda ,2021,4,"My son loves his game, it’s hard to get him off it!!!"
1107,Adriel,2021,5,Bang for your buck! Mickey LOVES it!(My dog)I Love the PlayStation 5 and all the money it brings me from scalping... Mickey enjoys it to! He gets new treats each time I sell a PlayStation. Highly recommend to buy if you can
1108,Alfredo Hernández,2021,5,Excelente al fin 👍
1109,Jake Delaney,2021,5,"Just beautiful, worth the wait!"
1110,Youngwildnfree,2021,5,Happy with my purchase
1111,WI.Grace,2021,5,"Its great so far, they nailed it with the new controller."
1112,Sebastian,2021,5,"This is basically a mid-high end gaming PC, spec wise. Its got amazing load times, fast and smooth rendering, and a good future proof selection of exclusives titles. if you can only get one console this generation this is the one.however its not without flaws, coil whine is real with this machine, i got lucky and got a quieter one, but there are many out there that sound like a fridge. no 1440p native support is baffling, it makes games look bad in 1440p monitors. the size is cumbersome and unwieldy but thats a concious design choice by sony.but overall an excellent buy. you wont regret it. the control is a bit bigger than the ps4 but the haptic feedback is great and immesirve."
1113,Exekuter,2021,5,Best instrument I’ve ever purchased exquisite
1114,Yusuf Kakar,2021,5,"This PlayStation 5 is the best console out there, it’s way better then any other Xbox made. It never heats up and when it’s up and running there’s no loud noises that it makes, I recommend it to anyone looking for a nice console to play video games on."
1115,Maximus,2021,1,"Like all other ps5 consoles they r worth 250$ and they selling them for 1200-1300$ and Amazon is allowing that,so just keep using amazon bc amazon is worthless garbage."
1116,Ludovic BOBE,2021,5,Awesone!
1117,Annalisa Dom,2021,5,Best play station!
1118,morales morales,2021,5,Just buy it if you can!!!
1119,JR,2021,5,Arrived it excellent condition
1120,Jose,2021,4,My box was already ripped
1121,julian ,2021,5,"finally got one! the hype is real! adaptive triggers, streamline ui. I consider ps5's to be the iphone of consoles, where the hardware might be weaker compared to xbox but the exclusives and ecosystem outweigh the cons. amazon actually delivers too!"
1122,Trina,2021,4,"Will update later as I get feedback from son and husband, but for now just relieved to acquire a PS5. After son ""worked"" to build savings for this in December, we would never come upon any available stock. Always missed the drops. Until one evening recently (April 2021) when Amazon thankfully miraculously had some stock @ $499 and we could snag one. So, almost 5 months of my son learning to wait nicely and build his long-suffering."
1123,Rafael Zamot,2021,5,Arrived fast and in good condition
1124,ebony62709,2021,5,This is a great game system.
1125,Zack,2021,5,"This console is amazing! The speed is so much faster, best frame rate, better graphics. I absolutely love it!"
1126,Daniel Boles,2021,5,Thank you Amazon for coming through for me! Been trying to get my hands on my first PlayStation ever and I am stoked!
1127,Johanthan Burnette,2021,5,"What can you say about it plays games great, and the only way to really play sony exclusive games. I'm a pc gamer but gotta have this for some games."
1128,Kareemafosheema,2021,5,For all those who’s having a hard time getting the PS5. It’s definitely possible. Keep pressing the add to cart. It’ll go through eventually. Good Luck
1129,Michael,2021,1,"Not enough fishes, overpriced, and honestly underpowered. The games I’ve played so far are extremely non impressive it still looks last gen at best a polished best of the best PS4 game. Sony fell wag off with this trash. They need to step up their hand in a major way, that is why Microsoft is dominating them. They even lost Bethesda to them.. very disappointed in this system so far. All show and no tell..."
1130,Johnathon.R,2021,5,Great console
1131,Julio A Ramos,2021,5,Nice
1132,Owen Mitchell,2021,5,The graphics are so nice! It performs very well and I have played so much Hello Kitty Island Adventure on it so far. It arrived very quick and is very reliable so far.
1133,Bebop,2021,5,I have so many pros not any cons so far the haptic feedback i amazing it feels like your in game only pro i could think of is you have to be strong because  this thing is heavy but if your lucky to get it know your in for something special
1134,Dat Smitty,2021,5,I received my Playstation an love playing Call of Dooty on it! It's a great console that do video graphics very good. My grandson wants to always take it to play Hello Kitty Island Adventure but that's super lame. Controller is also has joysticks.
1135,Jeffrey Castro,2021,5,Way quieter than the previous console and the graphics are immaculate. Would buy another for family if the supply was there.
1136,Joel lara,2021,5,Sheeee finally copped me one
1137,Miguel A. Vazquez,2021,5,A+++++
1138,Amazon Customer,2021,5,I never write reviews. Not only was it exactly what I ordered but it arrived a whole 5 days before expected. Would buy from this seller again 👍🏻 10/10
1139,Jacqueline smith,2021,5,We love it so far. Recommend downloading hotstock app on phone to know when these drop so you can get a chance at one at MSRP
1140,Luis Miguel,2021,5,"I liked it a lot, it is big, but it looks great on the shelf next to the tv. it is very fast, but the storage space falls short, I hope the expansion options are not expensive. I find the control a bit heavy compared to the previous one, but it feels good to play. I think because of the extra functions, the battery does not last long enough."
1141,Ramsey ,2021,3,"Amazing console with a huge catalog of games coming from PS4, it runs these exclusives even smoother. More PS5 games are coming and it will be nice to be able to play them at a smooth 60FPS. Still has a few software problems and no backwards compatibility. Some PS5s may have hardware problems such as loud fans and/or coil whine."
1142,Tristan Reenstierna,2021,4,I have enjoyed using this so far. However the size is a bit large. I have both this and the new Xbox and the PlayStation is definitely better and more fun to play on. Highly recommend.
1143,J,2021,5,I like that i got a ps5
1144,brandon mclin,2021,5,"As an overnight worker it was tough being awake for the constant ps5 drops. But luckily Amazon dropped some for retail price around 2am one night. Can't believe the luck. The system showed up today, and in really good shape, shipping thankfully didn't toss it about. Can't wait to play miles Morales, dmc5, and much more"
1145,Geidys,2021,5,I got it around 5 am ;) my son received it today in the mail 🥰🥰
1146,CCastillo,2021,4,"My oldest son really wanted the PS5, but it was nearly impossible to find anywhere until one day I hit the jackpot! I know that there hasn’t been many games out for the PS5 however the experience is worth it. The reason for this is due to the better performance of this machine. Compared to the PS4 slim, I don’t have to wait hours just to update a patch or download a game as it downloads at 600ish MBPS over ethernet on a gigbit line. The console feels fast with no pauses, stutters, and little wait time to get into a game. Any PS4 game that has weird stutters or graphic pop in no longer shows up on the PS5 due to its power performance. The PS5 controller feels great with its large size , feedback with rumble, and feedback triggers. It’s not all perfect though. There is some question when it comes to the controller as there are some people complaining about controller drift which I didn’t get as of yet. My personal issue with the controller is battery life as it only lasts under 6 hours from a full charge. This worries me as when the controller gets older, the battery life will just get worse overtime. The other issue comes to its size as it is almost the same as a mid tower desktop. The last issue which is minor is you can’t place custom backgrounds from or use purchased backgrounds from PS4 into PS5. That takes away as I use custom wallpapers to make the Playstation unique to myself. Considering all of this, I am glad that I decided to get this console not only to be able to play next gen games, but for higher quality and smooth gameplay which was often not the case when playing on a PS4 console. If only there was available stock as this was a pain to try and buy."
1147,Ross Miller,2021,5,I just got my system this morning. I have set it up and installed a few games. love the 60fps and new controllers.  the entire system is a much needed upgrade from where they were.  Very happy!
1148,Hazel,2021,5,"I ordered this one for my little sister on Saturday and it arrived today! Everything went smooth and now she doesn't have to bug me for mine lol For those wanting to buy, be patient. Your time will come eventually like my sister and I did. Mind you I waited 3 months after its release waiting for every drop and I was able to get this one for my little sister a month later. Definitely worth the struggle and wait!"
1149,Allen Alvarez,2021,5,Thank u Amazon everything is good 👍😁🎮
1150,Robert Smith,2021,3,"Had the system about a month now. Only issue I had was when the system turned on and off again. Only once. Other than that at least I actually got it within reasonable time, was packaged brand new and never been open. Only reason it's 3 stars is for price. Kinda ridiculous but that's scalping for you."
1151,Antonio Ritti,2021,5,Wow this for the ps5 really fast and nice packaged!!
1152,Alex,2021,5,"Got mine, suckers"
1153,Akabach Younous,2021,5,
1154,David W,2021,5,Love it!!!
1155,Cameron King,2021,5,144hz is clean and quality is crisp
1156,Amazon Customer,2021,5,
1157,Martin Agsaulio,2021,4,"I’d rate this a 4/5. The UI, at the current moment is kinda lackluster. I’ve had this console since February and I still don’t know how to get to certain places.  But I’d say that it’s still worth it if you want to play certain PS4 games that have been patched to have a performance boost on the PS5, like Ghost of Tsushima which now runs at 4K 60FPS. Anyways, this is a good console, if you’re even lucky to get one."
1158,Alex Czarniak,2021,5,Hold out hope and keep trying 5/5
1159,Karim mehnana,2021,5,Best !!!
1160,Luis Gutierrez,2021,5,Love my ps5 so much
1161,Vision313,2021,5,Very satisfied with my PS5 no problems at all
1162,Ariel S.,2021,5,Love it
1163,Nicholas wilson,2021,5,"i love everything about this console. i have been a playstation fan for a long time, and now that i finally have the ps5, my next-gen gaming can begin!"
1164,Antonio Gonzalez,2021,5,Super expensive. But arrived early and in good condition.
1165,Jet Li,2021,2,"I got this when it first released and from my experience, it overheats easily as well as crashes easily. Pretty sure that's just because I got an early production console. The controller feels nice, the graphs could be a lot better. Wouldn't recommend you paying over retail price."
1166,Jared,2021,2,"Not powerful enough, doesn't come with enough storage, accessories are too hard to buy because of shortages. I gave up on mine and bought a gaming laptop instead, which is limitless power and multifunctional. I wish I did not buy the PS5 because it honestly is not worth it, maybe if it was cheaper though."
1167,eltonvasquez,2021,5,Grasias
1168,Desiree Keylon,2021,5,Sony will always have the best consoles
1169,Daniel H.,2021,5,Super fast shipping. System is fast
1170,Debra  carpenter,2021,5,Happy hey
1171,D Hall,2021,5,Doesn’t get any better when you have an 8k tv too!
1172,Christopher P.,2021,5,Amazing product. Its a truly special experience when you have this and a great display to play on.
1173,Nicholas Maxwell,2021,5,"It was brand new, works perfectly love it"
1174,Jeremy Flanagan,2021,5,Came right on time and exactly as expected so nothing to complain about. Really glad I was able to pre-order on here and I didn't need the money till it shipped.
1175,Evan,2021,1,Do not buy at these prices. Do not spend your money to support scalpers like this.
1176,Jon d,2021,1,Not even from PlayStation rip off
1177,Screw Scalpers,2021,1,Buying a Ps5 with the intent of reselling it at a ridiculous price is disgusting
1178,Lin Stoddard,2021,1,That's outrageous price 😳. That's ridiculous!
1179,Chad,2021,1,At the time of this post they are listing ps5 at $1299. No one should have to pay more than double the price
1180,Amanda Davenport,2021,1,Scamer stop scaming
1181,De’Andre Jackson,2021,2,Dam 1200a
1182,Zach,2021,1,Trash 🗑 can't even get a ps5 now days thanks for nothing Sony!!! I won't over pay and be a sucker!!!!
1183,CG,2021,5,Love the PS5. It's controller really pushed the system feel like a next generation console.
1184,Timothy Petrose,2021,1,Still waiting months and months later to buy one. Still none.
1185,Matthew Strawser,2021,1,Cannot even buy it 4/20/21 quite a bit after release. Will not buy in the future.
1186,Corey thompson,2021,5,Love the PlayStation 5 and in excellent condition out of box☺
1187,Marlon B,2021,5,The cost but everything was intact.
1188,Clint I.,2021,3,"For this PlayStation 5 Console, I really enjoy the design of this console. It stands out and matches my theme of my room.  Upon set up, It came with the plug to function the PlayStation, a PlayStation 5 controller, PlayStation stand, and a charging cable for the controller. The package of it is clean and nice. There's 2 layers when opening the box. An outside layer showing the PlayStation 5 console and then a cardboard box shell protecting the inside. I will state my likes and dislikes for this console.Likes:- Design and Compatibility with PS4 games.- High definition quality when playing games.- 4k TV works really well with this console.- Controller feels really durable and better than the PS4.Dislikes:- A bit heavier than previous model of the PS4.- No games to really play.- I wish the packaging of the console was a bit smaller. It's too big for people to notice it.- No accessories included such as Camera or a media remote.Some suggestions, I would suggest if PlayStation wants to make their customer feel satisfied, they should provide a trial for any games from the PlayStation Store. Extra controller grips, just in case the default ones get torn apart or off.Overall, great product for a new generation console. I let my kids play it when they're finished with their homework. From time to time, I play whenever I get the chance or off work. If you only can afford a console, I'd pick this up rather than a computer."
1189,SD ,2021,5,"Great, if you can get one"
1190,Rhea,2021,5,It's great!
1191,maryanne lis,2021,4,Games system is awesome.  It's a shame I had to pay double the price to get it.  People just want to make a quick buck at everyone's expence.
1192,Shawn Bessellieu,2021,5,I like everything about it and came in the mail very fast.
1193,Andrew,2021,1,Sony employees are purchasing and then reselling for twice the cost. A lot aren't even making it to stores/warehouses. Sony is creating the demand themselves. That's why they won't make more
1194,A P,2021,5,"Fast shipping item as described, honestly thought my order would be cancelled but surprisingly I was lucky!"
1195,Michael Anthony Rainey,2021,1,It’s been maybe 5 and a half months since the release and the shortage of stock only got worse. I’ve been to every site (especially this one) almost every day for the past 5 or so months trying to get one but bots & scalpers are always here. Someone like me who has things to do still despite the pandemic existing stand almost no chance of obtaining one for ages unless we buy from an overpriced scalper. And I speak for everyone when I say this was the worst and unprofessional console launch of all time. THE SOULJA CONSOLE HAD A BETTER LAUNCH
1196,Vee B,2021,5,Worthy purchase and very timely delivery by the seller.
1197,James Rampage,2021,5,Love it!!!
1198,Little man Big,2021,5,"Came in one piece, aside that you probably know about the ps5 itself"
1199,William Castillo,2021,5,I just would like to know if he has accessories for the console. Please let me know.
1200,luis,2021,5,Exactly what is need for gaming if you don't have a PC. I also recommend the xbox.
1201,toonoo,2021,5,"Got it new in box, happy with the purchase"
1202,terrence goh,2021,5,"love this product, quick delivery amazing gift!"
1203,Robert Elstermeyer,2021,1,"I’ve owned every model since the first and at this point I’m done with Sony.  I have a gaming laptop with plans for an eventual desktop gaming setup because pc gaming has made huge strides and despite a higher entry price point, the return on investment is much better.  More games, more variety of games, better value, and most importantly more control as a consumer.  Which is what I’m really focused on now after so many lazy, out of touch, anti-consumer decisions by Sony.  They’ve gone full woke, moved their HQ to CA while many businesses are fleeing, have basically cut ties with its Japanese roots, abandoned a number of fan favorite dev studios and sequels, are recording every word you say in party chat for “future moderation,” have banned any criticism of Chinese Communist Party, plan to only focus on big AAA games in the future which means they’re afraid to take risks and support original creative visions, and more.  The tide is turning and they’ve become complacent and disconnected from their player base.  On top of all this, they release a new console fully knowing there would be a mass shortage.  It’s permanent free publicity, FOMO, and headlines.  They know this.  They don’t care"
1204,Mo,2021,5,Amazing console by Sony
1205,N. Barry,2021,5,"Months, months, months went by trying to obtain this, and FINALLY have it, I LOVE IT.....and now that I got Netflix/HBOMAX and DISNET+ on it I dont use nothing else to watch shows onnn even.....gaming and media all in one......."
1206,Steven Arthur,2021,5,It’s sitting next to my TV it looks good.
1207,Jason Walther,2021,5,Came in a timely manner. Box was shipped perfectly. I was worried about Fed Ex Damaging it but that was not the case. Playstation 5 is a great Console i am having so much fun with it. I would def buy again off these guys. Great Service. Thanks
1208,Marcus Bishop,2021,5,I love it!!
1209,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Ps5 what else do u want know works as expected no issues
1210,Damian,2021,5,Great console. Just buy it.
1211,Katie and butch,2021,4,"Good:Load times have been reduced to 30 or fewer seconds. 17 seconds to load AC: Valhalla. 4k is beautiful. Games run 60fps or ""Quality"" mode for intense and realistic visuals at 30fps. Controller is 10/10 with haptic feedback when shooting arrows in AC. Controller lasts a long time between charges.Bad:Unexpectedly powers off while in rest mode and this has happened to me 5 or 6 times since I bought it (mid Feb). Potential to damage the PS5 innards. Gets hot. Small memory. You'll see in my pics I am using a 1TB Samsung SSD because the console itself barely covers half a T of games and in 2021 and beyond, games are taking more and more space as time goes on. Want to keep at least 10 games installed so you can freely choose which one to play that instant? You're gonna need an external SSD drive, and I say SSD because you want to get the most out of your PS5's speed. This drive cost about $150, also purchased from AmazonOverall, fantastic but a little disappointed with the power shut off bug but bugs will come and go and Sony is always working 24/7 to update the console. I expect this bug to go away."
1212,Nientiendo,2021,5,...... Speechless 😶
1213,Dayne Ramtahal,2021,5,"Item arrived in good working order, been using it consistently over a month now with no noticeable issued, very pleased with product so far!"
1214,tim mcclure,2021,4,"PS5 is everything you want. plays games great, streams and plays media in 4k. I just don't like the UI that much and find myself liking the Xbox interface better. Still prefer to play on PS5 however! Dualsense controller is cool but doesn't add too much but is nice to have."
1215,april sweeney,2021,5,It took us forever to find the PS5 in stock anywhere. But it was so worth the wait. The graphics are superb. No wait time to load. Worth every penny.
1216,Ethan V,2021,3,"I have a 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos surround sound system and I wanted to watch some films using the 4K Blu Ray disc drive on this device. However, it has trouble connecting and recognizing the Atmos sound system, so much so that I just decided it's not worth the trouble to attempt to tinker and fix it, and to use a different device instead. For the amount of experience that Sony has in this industry, I expect a seamless and easy connection to my Atmos sound system. The controller is a step up over the previous generation, however the feedback triggers are too strong and make my hand cramp up while playing games that require their use a lot, such as FPS games. The design of the console itself is not aesthetically pleasing with a minimalist setup with a dark rosewood entertainment cabinet, so I keep it on the bottom shelf so it doesn't clash. It would have been better if it came in black instead of white."
1217,Javier Serrano,2021,5,PS5>XBX
1218,JLB5488,2021,5,This console is great. The games are beautiful well worth the price. The UI needs some work as it really cannot be customized. Also can't play any multiplayer ps5 games since no one else can get one. If you have the chance to get one at MSRP jump on it. Don't support scalpers let them lose a lot of money for doing this.
1219,Amazon Customer,2021,1,This is a piece of junk I wish I never purchased. The worst part is that Sony and or PlayStation do not stand by their product they are horrible. Don’t waste your money.
1220,Paul,2021,4,read above also not has powerful as the xbox series x and still has checkerboard 4k which is fake 4k makes the image blurry (checkerboard rendering is pixel then move over 1 no pixel then move over again pixel etc etc)
1221,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Love this system! I play it everyday and makes my PS4 games a treat to revisit.
1222,Jamie Gillis,2021,5,LOVE IT!!!! All I can say
1223,Bryan,2021,3,The coil whine on ps5 is crazy. It’s a shame that Sony claims this console is “whisper quiet.” It’s either all the testers were deaf or Sony changed the components of the pus to cheaper ones during manufacture.
1224,Victoria Price,2021,5,I love everything! Best graphics ever . 10/10 would recommend 🥳
1225,Dalina,2021,5,I was so exsited when I finally snagged one of these (: it’s an amazing console
1226,Donta,2021,4,It took awhile but in all the business was good well worth the wait..
1227,CHRIS,2021,5,I've bought 2 PS5s through Amazon. Both myself and the person I bought the other ps5 for are very pleased with our consoles
1228,Cliff Chamberlin,2021,5,It is amazingly fast when loading games and the graphics are mind blowing. The 4k blu ray player is so much better than my actual 4k blu ray player. I would recommend getting a remote but if your familiar with the controller you will be fine. The only downfall is just lack of games and accessories. The memory is low for what you get but in the future there will be a way to add an internal ssd and I'm ready for that. Other than that I would get this console when you are able to you won't be disappointed
1229,diana,2021,1,Stopped working after a week.
1230,Dennis K.,2021,5,Yay!!
1231,Jessica H.,2021,5,Has been running really good! Love how fast it runs and how fast the games load. The controllers are a big upgrade! Love them!!! Very nice and worth the money!
1232,Raul Velasco,2021,5,Great console. Works as expected. PS4 games look great on it.
1233,Bri Nelson,2021,5,My son was super happy and works excellent!
1234,Quentin J.,2021,5,"It’s powerful, fast, and looks great on my 70 inch Sony. What can I say it’s great. I just wish they were more readily available"
1235,Vincent,2021,5,sick !!!
1236,Vincent Cabibbo,2021,5,Just a great console for a great price at retail.
1237,shannon velez,2021,5,Would buy again
1238,Adam Kastmark,2021,5,"The ps5 in my opinion is just as good as I expected, but it is very big (in the photo you can see it next to my PS4 slim). Other than that I would HIGHLY recommend it."
1239,Jed Wright,2021,5,"Incredible console... main room for improvement comes at the hands of the HDMI cable, Feels cheap, and not quite long enough"
1240,Isaiah,2021,5,PS5 is fun  I do like thank you amazon :)_
1241,Terez Flanagan,2021,5,Great console I don't have any complaints
1242,Justin Wiley,2021,5,Enjoying every second of this Console. Been waiting for a while since it came out. Glad Amazon was able to secure me one.
1243,Blake Stewart,2021,5,Great console if you can find one.
1244,Evan Monroe,2021,5,"This was my first purchase of a console and I am not disappointed. It works well for streaming movies and my games look fantastic on it. I played ""The Last of Us"" and ""The Last of Us: Part II"" in succession after I bought it and the game crashed once in forty hours of gameplay. It's an excellent and stylish system that I will be using for years to come."
1245,angie,2021,5,"Hard to get, worth the wait. The PS5 is amazing (if you can get your hands on one) and you can definitely tell a major difference between the PS4 and the PS5. faster load times,better graphics"
1246,Paras Agrawal,2021,5,No issues at all! Package came earlier than expected!
1247,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Love it ! Play it everyday
1248,STEVEN MONTY,2021,5,"Well, I used it a few days. If you can get your hands on one totally work it.."
1249,Thet Maung,2021,5,Love it.
1250,troubledsoul,2021,5,What can i say its a ps5 lol love it great system
1251,Amazon Customer,2021,5,works like a charm
1252,King Spyda,2021,4,Its difficult to get but definitely worth it at $499.99
1253,yancey vazquez,2021,5,I bought one the previously broke I was able to score this one on Amazon and thankfully it hasn’t giving me any problems!
1254,paula marquis,2021,5,I think this is a great console and yes it might be very hard to get but it was worth the wait when i got it.
1255,Dominick,2021,5,"I bought the product for my son , he loves it"
1256,Ahmed Zulkarnine,2021,5,The best gaming system ever. Worth the money. Wish more games were available.
1257,Jayvee F Pichay,2021,5,Loved my Playstation 5. Plenty of games and hard drive space.
1258,Talesha R.,2021,5,Impressed with the speed of the ps5 and the shipping of Amazon! As a dedicated PlayStation and Sony fan I will say ps5 disappointed slightly in terms of advancement. But I’m grateful for the new console and games nonetheless.
1259,amira,2021,5,So nice
1260,Ricardo,2021,5,Next gen gaming at its finest!
1261,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Aside from being fortunate enough to acquire one, the PS5, like the PS4 (it's father before it haha) it's exceeded my expectations and has been an amazing experience in gaming. Good luck to everyone still on the hunt."
1262,Marcus Owens,2021,5,I liked the consoles overall performance
1263,Christopher Murphy,2021,5,"Well, I won’t say how much I had to pay for it, but at least feel vindicated for the first time. Just wished there was a better opportunity, though I’m grateful for the most part."
1264,karina williams,2021,5,"Awesome, my son loves it!"
1265,Luis,2021,5,Please restock digital version
1266,hector hernandez,2021,5,ps5 need i say more ....
1267,Lamonte,2021,5,The PS5 has great graphics and is very fast.  We didn't have to deal with the loading time to play Miles Morales for the first time.
1268,Fernando Pinheiro Carvalho,2021,5,"This is my first video game console, and I’m very impressed."
1269,patrick hasson,2021,5,"Finally!!! I got one off of Amazon, it was hard to acquire, this system is everything it is hyped up to be and more"
1270,Ruben Vargas,2021,5,Great start up speed. The graphics are legit.
1271,Nick,2021,5,A+
1272,Wayne M.,2021,5,It met all expectations and more . Entertainment not ok only for myself but my entire family .
1273,Stefan,2021,5,"Arrived packaged beautifully with no issues, pleased with the performance and design of the new console by Playstation"
1274,Erica,2021,5,The product arrived before the original date. It also performs great.
1275,James W.,2021,5,Shipping was very quick and I am enjoying my product
1276,Milly,2021,5,Came extremely fast in $500 dollars worth condition. Very satisfied
1277,Stacey,2021,5,This item came when it was supposed to and was in very good condition. Will order from then. Thank you very much
1278,Mageovet,2021,5,love this item but it really could have waited til this Christmas season to been released. There at not many titles to wet the mouth but with that said your old titles from the ps4 comes over amazingly.
1279,Romaine Eldridge,2021,5,Came in 2 days!
1280,jordan zettel,2021,5,PlayStation 5 kicks ass!! Lightning fast controller is so awesome. Hooked up my ps4 external harddrive now I have all my ps4 games accessible super easy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
1281,LELANDER,2021,5,Such a beautiful gaming machine the price was worth it because I can enjoy next generation games
1282,Jack,2021,5,I love the PS5. I can’t wait for more games to come out. PS4 feels flat in comparison to the experience of the PS5. The controllers feel amazing. The console is much larger but the design is beautiful. It is also very quiet. I saw reviews about it being loud but mine isn’t loud at all.
1283,Jay Lopez,2021,5,"Honestly, I don't know why I bought it. This thing is huge.  But will use it for the moment until I decide to return to PC gaming again."
1284,Nicholas Walther,2021,5,It’s awesome
1285,Bailey Alter,2021,5,Good
1286,Jordan Owens,2021,5,Definitely worth it This baby is Badasss.
1287,harold,2021,5,EVERYTHING IS GREAT .THE HARDDRIVE SPACE IS A LITTLE SMALL BUT I WILL UPGRADE IT IN THE FUTURE
1288,Diamonique Dyer,2021,5,So far so good everything was in the package my package came on time and in perfect condition no delays fast in easy it was so easy to contact seller they responded in no time I mean the price was alittle high but I knew the hassle of getting one but my son loves his ps5 only thing that matters thank you
1289,Isiah jackson,2021,5,As advertised.
1290,Jimmy,2021,5,
1291,Edward bradford,2021,1,Because it is the same as the PS4 it was a lot of money $500 no new games this PS five is garbage
1292,Jeff H.,2021,5,Very please with the PS5.  Have not owned a console since ps3 I switched back recently from PC VR gaming to this.  Overall I'm impressed there were no major glitches in the original release.  Updating is easy and the controller sensory adds a great layer to gameplay.  My only suggestion is to allow for automatic download of new game content when a disc is insertes.
1293,Jordan,2021,5,Goated
1294,Phil ,2021,5,The only thing that I disliked was the increased price hike on these consoles. Everything else was perfect!
1295,Bernice Battle,2021,3,Way to expensive. Brought It for my husband didn’t know I was over paying.
1296,Henry Valverde,2021,5,Great console!
1297,Kevin Almeida,2021,5,It was worth it (Price)
1298,zafar,2021,5,Very fast and amazing graphics. Even ps4 games runs like a dream on this console.
1299,Rohan Patel,2021,5,This is a big upgrade from my OG PS4 that is still running. Game load times are amazing and the clarity and responsiveness is a welcomed changed with the current state of SSDs. Would love to add to the storage already given but for now have all my PS4 titles on my external. The new changes to controller feed back on ps5 versions is pretty unique and cool. Takes a bit of getting used to but can't wait for GT7 to drop and feel even more while racing. GT sport plays flawlessly.
1300,Tyler Laury,2021,5,My PlayStation 5 arrived at my location without any damage or technical problems. I’m impressed that my package arrived soo early and I’m soo pleased about it. THANK YOU AMAZON😁😄‼️✨
1301,Jerry,2021,4,Omg I finally got one lol only thing I don’t like about the ps5 is that there really isn’t a way to access your messages and parties it’s really confusing at first and a hassle tbh you’re better of using the PlayStation app. I used an app called HotStock to help me get my ps5 it let’s you know as soon as a store has it I stock and on sale also there are Twitter restock accounts that also let you know when they are in stock. Good luck guys
1302,Dariel Santiago,2021,5,Best console ever!
1303,Jonathan,2021,5,"Amazing Product. Worth the money, and the wait."
1304,Clint Baylon,2021,5,Nice
1305,Evan,2021,5,The PS5 is excellent. My only criticism is that the console itself it too large. But I’m ecstatic I got one!
1306,land,2021,5,There’s no doubt PS5 is the greatest console of the current genre. It took me times to catching a chance when Amazon releases but worth it.
1307,David Fernandez,2021,5,"Console is as fast as advertised. It's definitely bigger than I thought, and I knew it was gonna be big. Next gen games load up super fast due to the SSD in this bad boy. Highly recommend."
1308,Melissa Ortega,2021,5,"I am IN LOVE with my console. I was lucky to snag one, and couldn’t be happier with it!"
1309,Lawson Davidson,2021,5,"Great product, never played just get a lot"
1310,Katiya McBride,2021,5,We got it ! So far so good !! My husband loves it ..
1311,ronald,2021,1,

1314,Sydney Odom,2021,5,I actually love it
1315,lc,2021,5,
1316,Vy Do,2021,5,"It’s cool I guess. I don’t even want it, i just got it because of all the hype. It is now collecting dust on my shelf."
1317,Christian,2021,5,10/10
1318,Shaunta,2021,5,My PS5 arrived almost a week earlier than it was supposed to. Brand new just as I viewed in online. Everything was legit. I’m very pleased.
1319,BruceWayne,2021,5,Love the PlayStation 5.  Runs smoothly and lets me play my games in the highest Quality. Love this system.
1320,MENACHEM H.,2021,1,My ps5 after 10 days wont turn on and amazon cant refund me because I cant send them the ps5 back 😪
1321,kurtis lane,2021,5,Finally got one🥳🥳🥳
1322,Axel,2021,5,This is the best console I ever played. Next gen gaming is here.
1323,Dawn,2021,5,Thank you  I am very satisfied and thanks for responding to my question  Thank you
1324,EEMAN,2021,5,"After months of trying to land a PS5 on various sights, I was successful on Amazon. Having been a PlayStation owner since the PS1 and owning every generation, Sony held true to their reputation of innovation. The PS2 incorporated a DVD player into the console, eliminating the need for both on that TV. The PS3 brought support for both HDMI 1080p as well as incorporating a Bluray player at half the cost of stand-alone players at the time. The PS3's  MOVE system eventually evolved into PSVR for the PS4 and a better camera system.Sony has offered a free USB adapter to use the PS4 camera in order to continue to utilize the PSVR as the HD Camera is not compatible. But Be WARNED, the website mechanism to get your free adapter is highly broken. It took random attempts multiple times a day, for a couple weeks to finally get the form submission going through. I dont think I will ever forget the serial number on my VR controller module.The one negative thing I can say about the PS5 is that it really is meant to be mounted in the vertical position. Unfortunately I utilize some wall mounted glass media shelves and their proximity to the big screen wall mounted TV is too close for vertical without obscuring the screen. In vertical mode the support base has a screw that screws right into the base to increase the sturdy aspect. However in horizontal mode it just sort of rests on the base with two pieces of plastic semi-hugging the back edge of the unit. If you bump it or move it, it slides right off the base. I would have liked to have seen the mount have a screw for this orientation too. Unlike other generations, there is no flat surface on the PS5, so a base is essential for all orientation."
1325,Boom-SWP,2021,5,"Powerful system, great graphics, a little large for my preference. Other than that I love it."
1326,Michael,2021,5,Amazing 10/10
1327,Carlos Zelaya,2021,5,"Got the product the very next day , super good experience"
1328,jorge estevez valera,2021,5,Great product i love it
1329,Thomas McDonald,2021,5,"I have to honestly say I thought I was scammed, but not only did I get what I paid for, it came a day early. So I'm a happy man. Thank you!!"
1330,James,2021,5,Can sealed and in perfect condition
1331,Greg M,2021,5,It's a true next-gen experience and the new controller brings it all together.
1332,Amazon Customer,2021,4,Shipped same day as bought and arrived earlier than expected and product is exactly as described and works great but my only dislike is that they charged 3 times the price it should have costed
1333,Jean Beauvil,2021,5,Amazing
1334,Ahad,2021,5,Amazing console. Great design. Console doesn’t scream like the ps4. Controller is definitely an upgrade. Love the haptic feedback. Logging in and loading into games is super fast.
1335,Jess,2021,5,Fiancé LOVES!!! And absolute hit for my little sister and her high school friends.
1336,Marty White,2021,5,Really fastest shipping and all good
1337,God,2021,4,"Overall good experience! ,  items was as advertise.  Just for something more delicate should be properly protected with bubble wrap."
1338,Ruthyviolet,2021,5,Love this console. The wait was definitely worth it.
1339,Kelsey,2021,5,IN LOVE. CANNOT BELIEVE I GOT IT. was literally in my college class and saw the notification that it was in stock. Took forever for the confirmation but shipped quickly.
1340,John W Graham,2021,5,"The console is fantastic. The 1star reviews about low supply, although true, do not do it justice. Playstation 5 is the future. The dualsense controller is so cool."
1341,Bapere19,2021,5,Boyfriend loved it!
1342,CJ,2021,5,Got it fast and works perfectly 👍👍
1343,Timothy D.,2021,5,Glad to finally get one! Everything they say about them is true.
1344,Mark Triviso,2021,5,This is the best thing I have ever boughten.It’s the PlayStation 5!
1345,Ryan Stanz,2021,5,"Works Great, no Issues. Love that i was actually able to get one for retail"
1346,Christian Williams,2021,5,Amazon clutch very reliable
1347,jerry e flippen,2021,5,Avery good running platform.....
1348,Deanna,2021,4,"Great graphics and a huge upgrade from the previous one. Everything loads faster and is alot more smooth. Controller feels nice and the console also looks great. There's a few downsides though. Not too many games out yet and its difficult to obtain for the majority of people. Hopefully, quantity of games and consoles improve over time."
1349,Kayden,2021,5,This is the second one I was able to get. Gave it to my nephew and he absolutely love it. I love mines as well. A 4K tv ain’t  necessary just to play games but it will make a world of a difference. Neither of us have gone back to our PS4’s. If you have the money get an LG CX. The combo of that TV and the PS5 is insane.
1350,Matthew ,2021,5,Great game console. I love it so much !!!
1351,daj,2021,5,Came very fast !
1352,Noah Feitosa,2021,5,It’s fantastic!
1353,Isaac Drummond,2021,5,I'm glad I finally brought this system even though it cost me so much.But I happy that I finally have one so I can experience and see what this console has store for me.My package is in and ready to be ship to my house.
1354,Josh M,2021,5,Such a fantastic console.  Beautiful graphics.  The new controller is amazing.  Upgrading to a 4K tv with HDR makes a world of difference as well!
1355,Dan,2021,5,Who knew how much more fun a game can be with haptic feedback? The console looks beautiful as well as the controller. I can't wait to see how games take advantage of the power of these new consoles.
1356,Prime Addict,2021,5,It's huge and awkward shaped but my husband loves it and he is happy.
1357,Justin Eugene DePugh,2021,5,Nice
1358,Official_singh,2021,5,Amazing console and fast delivery
1359,Albert,2021,5,Chill
1360,Chole,2021,3,Its great but not worth the effort of trying to get one for months on end
1361,Godofwell,2021,5,Fat w boys
1362,Amit Hasky,2021,5,"Great piece of hardware, enjoying it very much. Be careful, mornings becomes much harder when you buy this product"
1363,Adam,2021,5,Noce
1364,D. Downey,2021,5,"My grandson loves PS5.  I do not like how Sony released the PS5.  Great advantage to bots and scalpers.  Amazon needs to prevent bots and scalpers like in Europe and Amazon does not need to sell the PS5’s on Amazon at double and triple the price.  I hope the scalpers loose money due to their greed to purchase as many ax they can leaving customers at a disadvantage.I purchased the PS5 at 3 in the morning at the regular price and my grandson loves it,"
1365,Justin Lane,2021,5,Love it the console is awesome
1366,Eric Parker,2021,5,Far better than the Xbox. Glad I was able to grab one. Extremely fast download speeds. Graphics are amazing. Controller feels great. Love the triggers.
1367,Benjamin Aabakken,2021,5,nice
1368,Jeremy,2021,5,I love this product more than my girlfriend.  Highly recommended
1369,ANDREA,2021,5,An monster console with with greats aesthetics and other great features!
1370,DJ Geaux,2021,5,The setup was quick and gaming experience is amazing.
1371,Cody R.,2021,5,"Works great, just takes time getting use to if you’re used to a PS4. Every game I’ve played loads a bit faster, FO76 and Madden being the biggest changes. So grateful that Amazon got some in stock."
1372,Noah Johnson,2021,5,I liked that I finally got my hands on one
1373,Jeff ,2021,5,Everything was perfect
1374,Stefari,2021,5,"Was beyond lucky to secure this drop, to future buyers KEEP YOUR NOTIFICATIONS ON! If you don’t follow drop and restock pages, do so! I got mine at 4 in the morning on a Tuesday. Stay vigilant 👍🏽"
1375,Tu Xiong,2021,4,It wasn't easy trying to get one but when I did get it was fast delivery.
1376,Jonas,2021,5,Great product
1377,Tanner,2021,5,Way faster then expected. Great console
1378,Michael Rojas,2021,5,LOVE IT !!!!
1379,Ryan Bolanos,2021,5,Epic ...love it
1380,Andrea C,2021,5,"AWESOME. I was afraid I would get scammed, but to my pleasant surprise I received a perfect brand new PS5.I know a lot of people are upset about price gouging but I’m just happy I was able to get a PS5 when I wanted to. Also it arrived unexpectedly early.PS5 to my door in two days... couldn’t get any better than that"
1381,Andy,2021,5,Amazing gaming console ! Haven’t had a ps since the ps2 and I love it!
1382,steven shi,2021,5,I have playstation 1 and have been playing PS products since then. T he absolute best console ever!
1383,Albes,2021,5,Love the system hate the fact cod takes up all space and not a active ssd slot yet have to wait till summer to activate it
1384,Jose Martinez,2021,5,Setup is so fast.  No loading time.  Graphics are great.  Very satisfied.
1385,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Product was great, my niece didn't know what to do at first but i show her."
1386,Ryane Martinez,2021,5,Love it
1387,Mike McKenzie,2021,5,"Finally able to grab one. Other than the COMICALLY large size of the console, it’s great and is significantly more quiet than the PS4 Pro."
1388,Boburkhan Djumanov,2021,4,"Works like charm, I ended up buying Spiderman Miles Morales in addition to this in order to play, it runs so nice and works perfectly. Definitely recommend if you haven't bought it already."
1389,Btheman3 ,2021,5,"Great build, looks, performance. Overall best system I’ve had."
1390,J. Perez,2021,5,"Awesome but not a priority yet. The included game Astros playroom is fun and mildly entertaining. The only exclusive at launch is Demon Souls although it's basically a remaster of an old game. Console is pretty artsy to look at, fans mostly silent while on and internal ssd storage is fast.  Features like changing themes and nvme support aren't ready. I'd say it's still safe to wait until better games and inventory catch up but if you do come across a chance to buy one just do it."
1391,Emmanuel,2021,5,"Everything is fine, no crashes, buy it."
1392,stephen hyungjin park,2021,5,Great system!
1393,Ryan,2021,5,Best gaming console out there! Can play pretty much any PS4 game also! The controller is awesome only downside is the memory and they didn’t include a display port to get the better picture and use a pc monitor
1394,Robert Valero,2021,5,"Best console hands down, graphics are so smooth and the controller feel is amazing!  Very hard to come by but if you land one, it is an upgrade from the PS4."
1395,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"I definitely like the Ps5, I enjoy playing games with my friends and I liked how it immediately shipped to my house within a day of me ordering it"
1396,N. Cabrales,2021,5,Amazing!!!
1397,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"The ps5, so many people are unable to acquire. I myself tried to get one at 30 or so drops. And I never thought I would get one from Amazon. But one night of being up at 1:00 a.m. later, I have one. This console is a great improvement over the PS4 platform. The PS4 that I own is a first-generation, the destiny limited edition one. And this console blows it out of the water, the graphics, the speed and the overall polish to the console, four months after launch, are overall fantastic. I will say it is quite large but I'd rather have quite large and good cooling than small and overheating. It's also super quiet the fan only kicks in every once in awhile It's not very loud. But the biggest showstopper is the controller, the haptic feedback on these controllers makes it feel like you could feel raindrops on any portion of it, the adaptive triggers can make it feel so stiff it feels you're going to break it. Every person I have brought over to my apartment to play it, even if they're not PlayStation fans say the controller might be enough to turn them over and have them buy one. And as someone who has always been a PlayStation gamer, and I slowly transition to a PC gamer I can't say I regret the decision to buy one. Is it overall fantastic addition to my collection of PlayStation. And I can't wait to continue playing destiny 2 on it. I will update this in the future if any adverse things start happening, but until then fantastic console if you can find one (non-scalper) and I would highly recommend it."
1398,Olga,2021,5,"This console is amazing. Great Graphics and can support up to 120 frames per second. Also has great exclusive games such as Spider-Man Miles Morales, Demons Souls, etc."
1399,Adedotun,2021,5,"It's been really great so far, difficult to get but we'll worth the wait."
1400,Jennifer Payne,2021,1,"Horrendous product rollout. I've wanted to buy a PS5 for months now but am absolutely, positively never going to pay a scalper's 250%+ markup price gouge price. Let those people sit on a mountain of PS5s and lose money.I'm seriously contemplating converting to XBox."
1401,Ivan,2021,1,this item is not worth more than $500 + tax. Why would anyone pay more. Why would anyone sell for twice that?
1402,Brayan,2021,1,This is a scam
1403,Quindrick,2021,1,This isn't for the actual system just the Scalpers(those charging outrageous prices) that I'm reviewing. Do you not know the millions of PS5s are expected between now and April. Why pay double or triple the price? Then you're keeping essentials that came with the system and claim its still new. I will wait years b4 you ever get more than what the manufacturer is charging. Just greedy and ignorant. No thanks but No thanks
1404,Rocky,2021,1,Stop price gouging after you steal and use bots to grab inventory
1405,Cory Jimenez Jr,2021,5,Best system ever. Don’t even buy an Xbox
1406,Hector Diaz Cruz,2021,5,Fun good quality as always. Not surprising from Sony. Back to my PC
1407,Davieboy,2021,1,"If you are over the age of 30 and are complaining about not being able to play vidya because of Sony's incompetent ability to deliver products fairly, then you should be ashamed of yourself. As soon as ""downloadable"" content entered consoles with the ps3 and 360, video games died. Everything that has came after has been progressively worse. Forced political bs pushed in gaming, gambling, coins, dlcs... It's all so tiresome. Grow up"
1408,Gio Escobar,2021,5,Best thing ever
1409,Joshua Wimert,2021,1,This has got to be the absolute worst launch in video game history even worse than the Atari 5200.You are better off just saving your money for the inevitable Pro version within a couple of years.
1410,Henry,2021,4,game is okay. not to good not too bad.  look weird
1411,Eduardo Godinez,2021,5,Love the console works super fast and well. Definitely a great Christmas gift for your friends or family.
1412,Luke,2021,1,Wanna hear a joke? PS5 is coming out in 2022!
1413,Richard Newville,2021,1,and you can not get one yet but there shutting down ps4 programs
1414,Thomas,2021,5,PS5 came in good condition. Plugged it up and enjoyed playing bloodborne on it! Load times are considerably faster. A 4K monitor I ordered just came in so I will be able to fully experience the best graphics and frame rate for Ghost of Tsushima on the PS5.
1415,Omar O,2021,5,Shipped to me quickly! Set it up and play it almost everyday. The new controllers are great.
1416,Isaac,2021,1,They just lost a PlayStation customer over  ✌🏻✌🏻
1417,AVMQT28,2021,5,My son was so excited been trying for months to get a ps5 for his Christmas gift and finally received one!
1418,Jason H,2021,5,"Not sure what more can be said.  It's everything I expected it to be and works great.  Not much storage space, tho - so you might want to rethink installing the latest Call Of Duty."
1419,Abel Ring,2021,5,The experience on the PS5 really puts my old PS4 to shame. I really only have one tiny complaint and that’s how tall it is but I don’t really care about that.
1420,Tyrone Welborn,2021,5,Yes very helpful.
1421,Ee,2021,4,Not enough memory for games coming out but good so far
1422,Teonte,2021,5,Absolutely loving my PS5
1423,Amy Hughes,2021,5,I absolutely love my new ps5..i wont give a bunch long lists of pros and cons of getting one..its definitely worth the upgrade if you can get one..its worth it..im very happy..now i just need a 4k tv
1424,daniel e acosta salazar,2021,5,beautiful console I don't know how I got one on my cart lol
1425,Amazon_Customer,2021,5,"Once you get a chance to snag one of these up you will love it. This is a beautifully executed machine with a fun/funky unique design.I won’t dive into the specs, those are all over the interwebs.It’s the smooth running, next gen game playing machine that we’ve all been waiting for.Games have never looked this good, loaded this fast and with the new controller, been so immersive.At $499 it’s a bargain!"
1426,Samuel Smiel,2021,1,Awful.  Who has to wait to buy a expensive ass crap product! Us that’s who.  I hate Sony for this! Where the hell are all the consoles.  They don’t want people getting bored and loosing interest  cause they can’t produce any games.  Waste of time trying to get one.  Scalpers are worse then lawyers
1427,Janpaul1997,2021,5,By some luck I somehow got the order on the PS5 and I am enjoying it very much.
1428,I Electrician,2021,1,Not good
1429,Darrien Grays,2021,5,Bigger than I thought but very sleek and cool looking!
1430,Steve M.,2021,5,It’s fire
1431,sean diaz,2021,5,"Not gonna cap, I ordered a Ps5 from target when they were on pre order, I was so happy for it to be delivered I even waited outside just to make sure it was safe. To my surprise, I got a random delivered notification as I saw my fedex driver...pull up...and then drive away. He stole my ps5. I got my money back and vowed to go through Amazon. I got it one lucky evening and since then...IT IS AMAZING. What a good console. And thank you Amazon for actually having mine delivered. Your drivers are the best."
1432,Diane  Tison,2021,1,That’s RIDICULOUS PS5. Your console is not available at all. Disappointing.
1433,bombastic,2021,1,"Poor, poor, poor, release of a console. I'm sure one that will go down in the history books. Also not sure why Amazon is pushing peripherals when nothing is being sold?"
1434,Word,2021,5,"Works great and no issues. I don’t have a drift issue with my controller, the system is quiet as can be (though a bit loud when it is reading a disc), and it is fast. It makes playing older and newer games a blast, as the loading times are considerably shorter. I’ll need to get a better TV to see a considerable graphic improvement, but I have a new favorite controller (the Switch Pro Controller is a close second now).I was able to snag one by chance on Amazon (seriously, this is hard to get), and it makes sense that lots of people are frustrated with the PS5 low-stock situation; however, that doesn’t mean this product should have or allow countless 1-star reviews that speak nothing of the product."
1435,TyGuy,2021,5,"Do not hesitate to buy this item! Amazing performance, all my games run super smooth and the console never gets hot or loud! Insanely fast shipping from Amazon as always. Highly recommended!"
1436,Raul,2021,5,Huge improvement from PS4
1437,Parnell spears,2021,5,It's a good system but not worth more then retail price
1438,Dwayne Lynch,2021,5,The PS5 feels like an actual step forward into the next generation of gaming from the speed to access games and within games to the new UI to the new controller. The PS5 feels like something new. Which I assume is what your looking for when you buy a new generation of console. one feature of note in the new UI is the cards that give you a custom estimation of how long you would need to play a particular mission or section in a PS5 game or how much progress you’ve made towards a new trophy and simple as this is it really helps so you can better plan your “gaming session”. If you’re lucky enough to finally get your hands on one of these you won’t be disappointed. Pro tip if you have games on your PS4 I would recommend you move them to an external HD so you can easily access them on your PS5.
1439,Tiffany C,2021,5,Was waiting so long to order this. My friend loved it!
1440,Josue Gonzalez,2021,5,easy to checkout and now I'm playing the latest games with the latest console
1441,Yousif abou,2021,5,yes owrfect
1442,Ambaka Le Gregam,2021,5,"Yes, the PS5 is worth the hype. Graphics simply look amazing on a 4K TV. Controller is comfortable in hand and the overall gaming experience has been top notch. Product was also shipped fast and well packaged. 5 Stars!"
1443,MYRNA J RODRIGUEZ,2021,5,Best console ever!!!
1444,Dylan Yeomans,2021,5,Everything I hoped for and more!
1445,Franklin Serrano,2021,5,"Great service. Very difficult to get, though."
1446,Caezar Romero,2021,5,"This Console is amazing!!!! It's so fast and quiet I cannot stop playing it. The controllers are next level, I have never used anything like them. The pre installed game (Astros Playroom) pretty much brought me to tears with all the great gameplay, music and memories. I have been playing Playstation since I was 6 when the first console came out and I will say they have made it an awesome experience. Not only do they have the best games but i feel like they want to make the player happy. Thanks Sony!!!"
1447,Jirah Sanchez,2021,5,Thank you Amazon!!
1448,Cesar Nava,2021,5,Nice
1449,JDEZ,2021,5,This Console is everything it was hyped up to be!- 4K60fps HDR Game capture capability- AMD Navi and Ryzen latest tech with SAM-FAST SSD- Upgradable storage (soon)
1450,Osiris Rivera,2021,5,Love it !!!
1451,Meredith Schindler,2021,5,"Bought the disc ps5. love it so far. It's very quiet, and loads games fast. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
1452,Alexia,2021,5,"I'm so happy to finally get one, been trying since release. It came earlier than expected and there was very little box damage! I believe I used up all my luck for 2021 in getting this lol."
1453,Amazon Customer,2021,1,"Why can't sony make anything FUNCTIONAL? First the fiasco of stock shortage. After I spent 6 month and finally got one, the discs won't copy correctly, constantly getting errors and the DLCs I purchased is NOWHERE to be found. Why change the home screen layout that has been in existence since the PS3? This newly ""improved"" operation system is a DISASTER! I can't find anything I'm looking for. Where are my downloads!!? Where are my purchases that I could so easily redownload back on the PS4? This is real piece of garbage Sony! If I had a choice and if things aren't so exclusive with the PS system, I'd stay far, far away from it."
1454,Stephanie,2021,5,Finally got my ps5. Thanks Amazon product works great.
1455,robert,2021,5,The future is here with high speed load times and a new sleek design. Amazon is the only place I can seem to get one from without the bots buying them all up.  I have successfully obtained 3 for family members and friends only thru Amazon.
1456,Karen,2021,3,I’ve been waiting for a ps5 for the longest time and finally got my hands on it. I expected a little more from it and there are still a little bugs or glitches. Hopefully the next update helps it and patches the software. Other than that it looks beautiful!
1457,Parth Bhuta,2021,5,"Absolutely love the ps5. I was trying to get one from the pre-order days and it was just so difficult. Finally got one secured at Walmart, and they dint ship/ give any update on the PS5 for almost 40 days. Tried calling/ emailing and tweeting for support to no avail.Luckily, toward the end of the January, found out that amazon had a drop and was able to secure one. The drop lasted for just couple of minutes but the order process was flawless. It was just like placing another order. Much better, that spending hours on competitors website without any luck. It got delivered within couple of days as well. The box was damaged when it came by, but the PS5 was working fine and I just needed that.The graphics and gameplay is another level and really love the platform."
1458,Jefe,2021,5,"Love Sony, PlayStation 5 is the greatest! Worth every penny."
1459,Kevin King,2021,5,"Everything I expected it to be, also runs smoothly"
1460,Sam Tracey,2021,5,"To start this review off, I have had my PlayStation 5 since early January and sadly there's not many PlayStation 5 games that are interesting to me with the exception of Demons Souls and I of course bought that.  When I first got it, it personally took me some time to get used to the new menu layout as compared to the PlayStation 4  and thankfully my unit doesn't make too much noise , but if it does, I hardly notice it nor care for it because I'm having a good time with my console when I enjoy some Demon Souls or a video game.  Speaking of which I mostly have been playing quite a bit of my PlayStation 4 library due to the lack of PlayStation 5 titles available that interest me.  The performance on them is quite good and in some cases the games run at a more stable frame rate and  in others I notice some compatibility  issues with certain titles or notice some graphics glitches on some but honestly you aren't missing out on a lot by not having your PlayStation 5, due  to the fact that there's not too many PlayStation 5 titles out as of this review .  Now for the subject of the controllers,  I still personally prefer the PlayStation 4 controller over the PlayStation 5 because it took a while for my hands to get used to the new controller,  the controller was awkward for me but it grew on me, I thought about getting aftermarket accessories to make it more comfortable to wield.  Then there was the new awkwardness of dealing with the built in controller mic, if you're the type of person that streams and you don't want your voice to be heard while doing so, make sure to mute the mic on your controller, so that way when it's uploaded to somewhere you won't have embarrassing moments being heard on your stream  or some sounds you make when dealing with a hard video game :]  Finally, let's talk about the party chat system, it's a lot more better in my opinion because when I was on my PlayStation 4 Pro, or regular PlayStation 4 when I had one, I would sometimes get a party chat invite, and when I wanted to join it, I would hit the PSN logo and join it, but in most cases it would cause my game to freeze very badly and in some cases crash my game when on PlayStation 4, but now when I get an invite and join a party, I don't have to deal with freezes or crashes anymore since it's more streamlined.  In a nutshell this console is great so far but it just doesn't have too many PlayStation 5 titles at the moment, so don't feel bad if you don't have one yet, personally I think Sony rushed this console out too soon ."
1461,Michael,2021,5,"After tracking and trying to buy ps5 for months, Amazon pulled through. I feel your pain but keep at it and it will be worth it. The ps5 is pretty much everything I dreamed it would be. Spent an hour touring Manhattan in Spider-Man. The hdr, 4K, ray tracing, controller is incredible."
1462,Avalanche09,2021,5,"In my opinion, the PS5 beats the Xbox Series X with no questions asked!  The PS5 controller is probably the coolest thing ever!  It's so far advanced over Microsoft's same old boring controller.  The PS5 is really worth the hype and the wait!  Thanks be to God for securing this for me at 3:30 am one morning :)  Keep the faith and you will get one soon!  Thank you Amazon for the same day shipping!  :)"
1463,Mailman,2021,5,"It’s a really good system, I was excited when it came through Amazon."
1464,The 48,2021,5,"IF YA’LL WOULD SOEND THE ENERGY TO ACTUALLY LOOK FOR ONE INSTEAD OF SPENDING THE ENERGY CRYING AND COMPLAINING, YOU WOULD ACTUALLY FIND ONE! I DID! ON REGULAR PRICE TOO! Twitter Trackers Help!"
1465,Michael & Sarah Yarina,2021,1,This is simply out of control now.  Scalpers are buying up all the systems and trying to sell them back for crazy amounts.  ($499 product for upwards of a $1000!!!)This should be a crime and cracked down on.Oh well guess one day in the future I may be able to buy this amazing console to go along with the few games I already have for it!
1466,R. Rodriguez,2021,1,0 supply and no way in heck I'd buy from resellers.
1467,Hugo Jimenenz,2021,5,It’s awesome 😎
1468,K. Moorehous,2021,1,My PS4 is fine. I don't need a PS5 that bad. I refuse to pay the scalpers.
1469,Jon,2021,1,"I’ll buy this garbage when I finally get my chance, but this wait lag is unacceptable. All these great games out there most of the world is t getting to play... shameful. Not fair to developers, not fair to millions of gamers."
1470,Alfonso,2021,5,Good amazing
1471,Nopublicname,2021,5,Haven't played in a console since the Xbox 360 and haven't played a PlayStation since the second one but what I can tell you is this PlayStation is very fun the controller is amazing the console design is weird and is significantly larger than I thought it would be but overall fun and that's what's important.I wasn't one of the people that were trying to buy the console day one week one or even month one so I haven't really experienced the frustration of the scalpers but I'm going to tell you that they will only hurt the console in the long run and also it's incredibly rude to do that to your fellow humans in any state let alone a pandemic. Those people really need to rethink their life.
1472,Jose,2021,5,Loved
1473,Devin Willis,2021,5,"Came within 2days, very satisfied with the PS5 😄"
1474,Robert lopez,2021,1,Sony is trashWon’t play their stupid game of resellers
1475,Wasif Hussain,2021,5,Graphics are exceptional
1476,Edgar Santana,2021,5,10/outof10 would recommend.
1477,Deadstocked Soles,2021,5,"The item came really fast and they let me switch my card after my bank blocked the charge, I was really happy that it wasn't cancelled!!"
1478,Michael M.,2021,5,"Finally got it with actual price, console is bigger than Ps4 in size but looks amazing, I love it."
1479,no money,2021,5,Great product easy use I would definitely recommend this seller .They were professional and courteous
1480,Wes,2021,5,Great console. Haters gonna hate. I love it.
1481,LATER T,2021,5,Thank God I was blessed to get one system so great I got a new TV to match
1482,Salman Ahmad,2021,5,Great console finally was able to get one.great controller and load times are lightning fast
1483,Denise allen,2021,5,I like it havent play it yet  look cool
1484,B. Martinez,2021,4,"As a PC gamer I'm surprised by how great the graphics on the ps5 are. I tried Spiderman with ray traycing on @ 30 fps and was blown away by how beautiful games look on my Q9 TV. Games load very fast so no more waiting!  Is it better than PC? No, but its a solid console that will have me gaming on console again. My only issue with this console is that its Huge and ugly. Worst looking console ever. I can't make it look nice in my entertainment center no matter how hard I try. It's just way too big so consider where you're going to put it. One thing about the size though is that it allows better cooling so no more jets taking off in your living room. It's actually pretty quiet.I dropped a star because of the ugly design.I'm happy with my purchase. If you can get one at retail price get it! If you pay over retail you are part of the problem.HaPPY gAMING"
1485,Adnan,2021,5,"Great system. It was fun reading the reviews here, I had my popcorn out... thanks guys !"
1486,Mitchell Trevino,2021,1,Scalpers
1487,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"it is just another video game console, so if you're expecting it to be anything more than that, you may be disappointed.the first time you feel rain through the dualsense, though, it will actually make you smile.  the adaptive triggers are amazing.  the speaker on the controller is genius."
1488,Amazon Customer,2021,1,Litterally March 2021 and no PS5's in sight cause of freaken scalper scum and the companies are doing nothing about it. There are groups now with tens of thousands of PS5s selling them triple the price it is truly insane!
1489,F.Rod,2021,1,"PlayStation may hold majority market share in relation to its next competitor but it’s only because it has been around a console decade longer. This console uses antiquated cooling hardware and is oversized. The HDMI cable isn’t 48gps like other 4UHD cables and worse is that the console outputs only compressed audio and video. Limited exclusives and no real “GAMEPASS” subscription services leaves me wanting more. The PlayStation 5 is relying too heavily on its brand name like the rest of Sony products (i.e. subpar TVs using LG panels). Hopefully there are more AAA titles released in the next two years and third party developers make use of this new controller, which will require additional programming and operate at the expense of battery life, and will likely not be adopted or fully utilized outside of first party games."
1490,J_ Aguallo,2021,1,Cant even keep up with the demand that’s sad
1491,PMac761,2021,1,The lack of inventory & the fact Amazon & others have done NOTHING to prevent scalpers and stop after market inflated sales is stupid. If I have more than one PS5 in my cart I should be prevented from buying them. If I can't buy more than one can of Lysol at a time then this should be limited also. I hate Sony and will continue to support XBOX
1492,Kevon,2021,1,"Imagine being a longtime fan a Sony, you've had all the consoles, you're still paying for playstation plus even though you've sold your ps4 to buy the next gen months ago and still cant get it. I'm 27 yrs old, I thought I would never grow out of gaming. I was wrong, the gaming world had left me and million others like me behind. I'm upset."
1493,Pandagurl,2021,3,"I’m usually an early adopter of video game systems, and with the ps5 launch I bought into the hype and couldn’t contain myself. However upon purchasing the major launch titles and when the excitement died down, in all honesty I wish I had waited to buy the ps5. At this time there isn’t really a killer launch title thats worth buying for the ps5. Astro’s play room is a fun tech demo that shows what unique gameplay the ps5 is capable of, but the reality is that at this time and especially if you have a PlayStation 4 there is no real reason yet to upgrade. There’s no exclusive ps5 title that is mind blowing. The graphical improvements in the current line up despite connecting to my 4K 75 inch tv is not that great of leap from the ps4 and especially if you own a ps4 pro. I would recommend waiting on upgrading to a PlayStation 5 until there’s a game that’s released that really takes advantage of it."
1494,Brent da Silva,2021,1,No point even trying to buy. Sold out instantly
1495,Mikeoleen,2021,5,"It's a PS5, it's amazing."
1496,Christian Jones,2021,1,"That moment when you know roughly a quarter of the populace in most first world countries wants your product and instead of building more to compensate, you stick to only producing your base 2.5 million units. Not even accounting for the approximately 497,500,000 people who want one. I understand it’s realistically infeasible to expect a company to produce that many on launch day. But they damn well know that 2.5 million won’t cut it. Now I’m hearing we won’t get more in stores until 2021 Black Friday?! And the scalpers! Why is Sony rewarding that kind of behavior?! Garbage. They believe in supply and demand. If they refuse to make units, the supply will go up and then the demand will go up. Really shooting themselves in the foot. People will just get so fed up with it they don’t have any demand eventually. Here’s my words of wisdom. BUILD/BUY A PC. Performs better and plays better than a ps5 ever will. Sure you got PlayStation exclusives, but likely you won’t have to worry about that until ps4 goes out and they stop making games for it. They’re making all ps5 games for ps4 rn as far as I know. Anyway garbage company with a corrupt plan."
1497,Mike D,2021,5,The latest and greatest. Far superior to the ps4 in every way. What are you waiting for? Cop!
1498,RMonst3r,2021,5,Thank you Amazon. Playing older titles at 60 fps is an amazing experience so far. Can't wait to see what developers and Sony does for this console in the future.
1499,YA-YA,2021,5,Excellent and came pretty quickly it's definitely the future of gaming
1500,CoolE,2021,5,It’s a great console and it’s huge!!!
1501,Angel,2021,5,Took a while but im happy to have finally got one good luck everyone still trying
1502,Riley,2021,5,Makes Destiny 2 frame rate as smooth as butter
1503,Codey Justin Fields,2021,5,"If you can get it retail, that's amazing good for you. But there's not enough games to justify a scalped price. Unless you really love demon souls but id still say wait on it. Good luck."
1504,ZLMom,2021,5,"So far, this console has been amazing. I mean, the PS4 was really behind in hardware so I'm not surprised. It was really hard getting a hold of one of these, but I'm really glad I did.To be honest, I bought this console to play Genshin Impact which runs so slowly on the PS4. I've only played a little bit of other games on the PS5 but I have to say, Genshin Impact runs smooth as butter. Loading times are so fast (even faster than my spouse's PC sometimes!) and it's so beautiful that it looks like a different game.It's a steep price for entry, but if the life cycle is as long as the PS4 was, it's totally worth it for the huge upgrade in hardware."
1505,Richard McDaniel,2021,1,Never available to buy! Worst launch for real gamers ever. Only scalpers with products at jacked up prices:(
1506,Devon,2021,5,It arrived really fast! Playing Spiderman looks so amazing on next GEN. I have  no complaints my PlayStation doesn’t even make any sounds.
1507,tristan garcia,2021,3,"Everyone claiming that this is abuse isn't aware of the world's political climate. Do research on chip shortages. It isn't just Sony choosing to lose $$$. Scalpers are the huge blame but mostly the chip shortage for political reasons. Yes, I'm livid beyond the heat of the sun but what can we do but understand wtf the issue is before assuming such things."
1508,A. J. Gillespie,2021,5,"It came quickly, was packed really well and works great."
1509,Jeffrey Bartemeyer,2021,5,Love my ps5!
1510,Brendan,2021,5,I got one haha
1511,Jorge Donjuan,2021,5,Awesome console!!!
1512,Slynk,2021,5,"I know that the launch stinks. I was a person killing myself to get this as well. I actually was able to get the new Xbox since the PS launch was so rough. Figured the Xbox would hold me over. One day luck was on my side and I was able to order one through Walmart just before Christmas. So I had this system for a while now. By far, it blows the new gen version of Xbox away. Newer games look simply amazing on PS5. I haven't had any weird hick-ups with Spiderman or COD CW. Warzone is my main game of choice right now and they keep adding HD texture updates that make the game look more and more amazing then on any other system (except maybe PC if you have a nice rig). Playing older PS4 games is nice as well. No real HD upgrades to the graphics here but much much shorter load time and even without graphical updates, most PS4 games just look better on my PS5. I havent played it much but CyberPunk was so much better and just look much more amazing on the PS5 then any other system and I played it on the Xbox One, Xbox Series, PS4, PC (not a great one though), and now PS5. Also the PS Plus upgrade for PS5 is great. It now comes with PS4 classics which includes some amazingly good games and the monthly games are A+ if you ask me. FFVII was just released yesterday and its barely 1 year old. Sound is good - amazing if you pair it with the Sony Pulse 3D headset. Many more kills in Warzone just because I can easily hear other players and know exactly where they are. Appearance-wise, biggest system I ever owned. I def did not like the look in pics but in-person it actually looks pretty cool. Its solid and almost feels like an expensive PC tower (not as big though). It feels heavy duty. Over the past few months I have been moving around a lot and taking this with me, not a scratch on it. Its been doing great. Only negative I can think of is the amount of current PS5 games out. Originally it was barely any. Seems like they are adding more regularly and PS4 games are getting nice upgrades. Anyway overall, great system. I wouldn't say the Xbox Series system even comes close to this. Moving from the Xbox to PS5 is almost like moving to a newer gen system... but the Xbox Series is a next gen system....Anyway, hard to get a PS5 but so worth the effort when you do."
1513,Natalia Hanchas,2021,5,Yes
1514,Raegen Lang,2021,5,got it for retail baby!!!
1515,Charlie Phillips,2021,1,"This trash is available for minutes before suddenly out of stock, yeah fine. I've been try'n to buy one MONTHS and EVERYTIME their in stock, bam gone. That's it. I'm done."

1521,Heather Crabtree,2021,5,Amazon lets all the bots get the PS5s. Id imagine your quality goes down. Here we were thinking Amazon was a good company sure
1522,Juan Cerda,2021,5,"I love it, playing the astro playroom is definitely something you guys should try before playing any other game."
1523,dxn-solutions,2021,5,Excelente era lo que esperaba solo algo mas pesado de lo que pensaba.
1524,GodIsGood,2021,5,"I’m very happy with the console so far, what helped me get 2 consoles(one for me and one for my cousin) other than a lot of prayers lol was the nowinstock telegram app, I set the notifications on high and acted as quickly as possible and was finally successful. They also have text alerts on their website but I found telegram to be the fastest. Hope this helps someone out there;)"
1525,WMitchem,2021,5,"Amazon made this so painless & fast. I was able to get my PS5(standard) a day after I ordered it. I’ve had the ps5 and the series X since the end of January, and I’ll say having them paired with my 65” LG CX OLED just hits different. I had just purchased a digital ps5(was the only one I could get atm) from PlayStation direct 2 days prior but when I had the opportunity to get the disc version instead, I did. Ended up selling the digital version to a friend and kept the one I wanted.  Both are amazing systems, just can’t wait for some really good titles to drop for them."
1526,A Guy Who Buys Stuff On Amazon,2021,4,"I'd like to start of by saying that I'm in love with my console, I only chose to give it 4 stars though because this thing is MASSIVE. It's both taller and nearly as wide as the original PS3 which was unit in and of itself. The PS5 console is great besides that and the build is quite nice. The Dualsense controller is absolutely perfect but I recommend turning off the adaptive trigger feature to prolong your controller's life; both from the physical and battery side of things.The console runs cool and isn't exactly whisper quiet as has been said but it isn't the jet engine that the previous PS4 was. The black strip that runs down the middle of the console is prone to both fingerprints and scratches so please be cautious."
1527,Starmark,2021,5,Fun.
1528,DDDDD3978,2021,5,"The graphics and higher framerates are nice, but the most noteworthy feature in my opinion is the new controller. With the adaptive triggers/HD rumble (Seems like the same company that made the amazing Nintendo Switch rumble made these as well) make games so much more immersive than what I was expecting. The design of the console itself is a bit questionable, but I think it will grow on me eventually. Hard to buy now but hopefully becomes more widely available in the future."
1529,Sharifah,2021,1,Buy an Xbox trust me. New PS5 is a waste of money.
1530,Cristian Tinoco,2021,5,Very happy with this purchase I hope everyone can secure the bag too!
1531,Erin Wilson,2021,5,Hubs is happy. Keeps him busy for hours.

1535,CarolTecGame,2021,5,"The quality of the console is really good , good material and beautiful design , compatibility with PS4 is really good and at the same time offer free games as part of the PLAYSTATION Collection Program. Blue Ray quality for movies is also very good and in general very quiet."
1536,Lance Wheeler,2021,5,"Got my ps5 after a few months. Snagged it at 4 am, lucky me. It runs really well and you can definitely tell that the SSD runs well. Only problem is that you get around 667 gb of space."

1543,Brandon cairns,2021,1,I find it pretty sad that people are still having a hard time getting these. It's pathetic actually
1544,Victorsorullo,2021,5,Good
1545,Mike,2021,5,Works as advertised
1546,Dequentin,2021,5,"Best console to date. Super fast load times. The games look incredible, but the best feature while playing on this console has to be the adaptive trigger function. Well worth the wait it only to me a month to purchase this console. I waited until the end of January to search for one. Do not pay over $1000 for this console its great, but not worth over msrb price. Beware this console is very tall and bigger then the new xbox, make you have space for it."
1547,Stephanie B,2021,4,"Update: Sony has fixed many things originally listed and complained about. Sony has stepped out their game once again with their games, near future release schedule, and overall PlayStation experience. If somehow on can get PS5- it has my complete recommendation at this time.However, this is still easily the most unprofessional launch of any product I have ever witnessed. And a year or two later the PS5 seems it won’t improve much. Terrible and beyond terrible experience. They should be obligated legally to find a reasonable solution. Only online ordering is the stupidest solution. Bots and people reselling for double the cost, no warranty as they are not authorized resellers, hurts the gaming community and shows how little care one has for us. Truly disappointing and insulting.PS5Pros:1. Access to upcoming and PS5 games.2. Upgraded PS4 to PS5 games.3. 60fps4. 4K Blu ray Player.5. Fast download speeds.6. Sony exclusive games/ PlayStation features such as trophies etc.7. A quieter 4k blu ray player compared to Xbox series x for movies.Cons:1. Disc games very loud. Try last of us part 2.2. Almost all backward games do not look good. Pop in issues, noise/static in dark areas, controller response poor. PLUS games that have been updated, like 4 PlayStation exclusives as of 2/28/21** are not locked 60fps and have a much lower view range to obtain the 60fps. (Mostly Fixed)3. Doesn’t download games in rest mode gives errors. (Fixed)4. The controller joy sticks not as smooth as ps4 controllers, but bigger and better beyond that.5. Cant customize games on Home Screen.6. Absolutely no space for games or any reliable upgraded storage.(Semi Solution)7. Has errors with network and downloading digital games. (Mostly Fixed)8. Extra unusable space is required with the games already known file size.9. Poor store and game layout. Certain games you have to rebuy as the version one bought somehow are not playable on ps5 plus nothing truly organized without manually setting A-Z. (Mostly Fixed)"
1548,Okonkwo,2021,5,Fast Shipping and the PS5 Box was flawless
1549,Steeler fan 90,2021,5,Arrived on time and the delivery was smooth. System has been great so far.
1550,Zach B.,2021,1,"Nintendo rolled their consoles out better than Sony. Let that sink in. A company that manufactures a ton of different electronics, was beaten out by a company that builds more video games than electronics. Go build a PC, the pathetic roll out of the PS5 convinced me to build a gaming computer, couldnt be happier. Be better."
1551,whig,2021,1,It's been four months and bots are still buying all of these.
1552,Raik_Havok,2021,3,"I haven been able to get a ps5 this entire time, checking amazon, best buy, target, B&H, gamestop, and even walmart, the biggest issue is the bots buying them all up for resale at stupid high prices. I think to prevent the bots from snagging them all up...should give simple yet numerous RANDOM math equations...simple multiplication, addition, subtraction....or not even math, an actual survey, ""whats your favorite playstation game?"" ""how many hours did you put on it?"" ""what is your favorite genre?"" ""who is your favorite character across all playstation games?""im sure they could make those kinds of questions.....who cares how hard it is to do...Nike. has to be alot, and different for everyone....i know its ridiculous, i just want a ps5...i saved up for one for release day......gimme"
1553,Kyle Nguyen,2021,4,"The PS5 provides a great punch to my gaming life. Playstation Plus provides such great add-ons to the playstation. More than 15 games with a subscription, all remastered to meet next gen specs? Don't mind if I do. I admit though, it was pretty hard to get a PS5, but it was well worth it in the end. I never got to play classic Playstation exclusive titles, and I would like to thank Sony for providing most of them with their subscription. I'm only docking off a star because I feel like the price of consoles just spiked up so much to the point where you can get a PC with a wider library for that price and the same specs/experience."
1554,Naren Krithivas,2021,5,"Amazing system, super awesome performance, and an amazing controller. I’ve had the console for about 2 months now, and it’s my favorite PlayStation yet! I’ll get my complaints out of the way first:Limited SSD storage -667 gb usable means get an external to install your games!Archaic UI- So many settings are buried in weird menus, and even though I’m used to the switch of long press on the ps button, the quick switcher takes too many steps. Turning off the console, adjusting volume, creating a party are buried beneath so many taps and sub menus it’s infuriating.Limited IO- The ssd expansion is still locked for now, expected support is summer 2021PROS:Controller- even if the game doesn’t take advantage the vibration and feel of the new controller is awesome! Mic is passable but is helpful for quick chats. Make sure to turn on mute on login!Performance- games run great. On ps4 games the performance boosts in load times and frame rates are noticeable! A lot of games do have patches by now but very few are capped at 30. However, it is extra work for developers.Thermals- except for the disc spinning every now and then, the console is almost silent during even heavy gaming!Overall, I love this console and while the design is not my favorite, the performance and games alone are worth it!"
1555,Jorge Febo,2021,5,I love it. Glad I don't have to complain like everyone else
1556,Rob M,2021,5,Love it!!! Just get one
1557,Matteo,2021,3,"Ethernet port keeps disconnecting bc I guess it was made very loose and cheap, the controller lost its patent on the joysticks so they will start to have drift as they wear so all an all PS5 is very cheaply made and probably won’t last long and they have no recalls bc they don’t care"
1558,Nicole,2021,5,"The delivery was awesome! and it came fast, there were no scratches or missing cords it was in good condition."
1559,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Best thing ever
1560,Nish Mistry,2021,5,"I'm glad I was able to finally purchase this console after MONTHS of trying, but wow, is this miles ahead of the PS4. Although it's larger and doesn't really fit where I used to keep my PS4, this console is an absolute beauty, and outperforms my expectations.The Console itself:Having the disk is nice for older games, and in general I just like having the physical copies of the games laying around, but that's just me. Overall, I enjoy the design, even if I would've preferred the console to be black. It's performance is stellar on all games. Nothing much more to say other than: all the other reviews you've seen are right--the PS5 is amazing.The Controller:I thought that I should comment on the controller since it was a fairly large change that they made from the DUALSHOCK controllers of last generation. I enjoy the larger size, the texture is great--it has a good balance between grippyness and slipperiness that is much appreciated during gaming sessions. Additionally, its design is much more ergonomic than the DUALSHOCK ones, so after playing for a while, my hands were still feeling comfortable and not strained. One of the coolest things though, was the better rumble that they added, as it creates a much more immersive environment. That, mixed with the new triggers that they added, makes single player games much more enjoyable.TLDR; Worth the wait, lives up to the hype. Amazing!"
1561,Armando zamora,2021,5,Dope
1562,MIchael Brown,2021,1,Not impressed
1563,Joe L. Cobb Jr.,2021,1,"The games as usual are the games exclusive to a console I’d buy. Problem is multiplayer for demons souls won’t be alive forever. It is a remaster.Now it’s been 5 month since launch. The fact that authorized retailers and Sony hasn’t price regulated this thing so opportunistic internet shoppers can’t make money off of people in ways thats nothing other then disturbing during hard times should really make you question who you’re buying from when it finally happens for you. I won’t buy from a 3rd party retailer for more than $50-75 above cost.I have the money, it’s the principle. Not supporting it. I’d pay extra to have Sony hold one for me at this point than pay half the cost so scavengers can make money off me.Keep in mind they’s no guarantee they’re new, or not tampered with or any of those reasons that would benefit them. This is scum strategy, people have received rocks in ps5 boxes from these $900 retailers.Nintendo switch has a lot of games that used to be PlayStation exclusive, and it’s cheaper and easier to get. Do yourself a favor, grab one of those for cheap and keep yourself busy til supply finally can come close to the demand and no one person is sitting on boxes of what amounts to the misery of other people. Make more off the stock market anyways this is just dumb."
1564,Bryant Hernandez,2021,5,have loved it so far it’s the best consoles have to offer in my opinion
1565,Lania,2021,5,"Exactly what we’re looking for, had it for about 5 months and no issues"
1566,Amazon fan,2021,1,when I try to add it to the cart from Open Home it says it won work. Come on amazon I trusted you.
1567,Taha,2021,5,Very pleased
1568,Christopher Edmonds,2021,5,After so many tries. Finally
1569,Gamesforme,2021,5,"Product was awesome packaging could’ve been better as there was damage to the box, they just need to handle these $500 electronics a little better I think!"
1570,Huxley,2021,1,"Dying. Scalpers. In a pit full of wet dook. Begging for a wet wipe. But no! We have our dignity! So back to my, eh hem, PS4.."
1571,Anh T.,2021,3,"After waiting for so long to order the ps5, the item was short of expectation. Fan was super loud and the system got hot constantly. Controller is an improvement though. For what it's worth, if you can't buy this, just buy a PC."
1572,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Next generation!
1573,JCW,2021,5,Muy satisfecho con la compra.
1574,Mario,2021,5,The Ps5 is great super fast. Definitely a upgrade from ps4. So if you are deciding should you but it you should definitely get it. The only problem was being able to buy it but other than that great prude to.
1575,spencer,2021,5,"love the ragers complaining about not getting a ps5, you guys just aren't trying.........."
1576,KEVIN DELGADO,2021,5,"if u have a regular ps4 u need a ps5 asap.. if u have a ps4 pro u can wait, it's not worth paying scalpers i have a regular ps4, not a ps4 pro n the upgrade is vast since now i have 4k 60fps. the new controller has a way tighter rumble almost like a buzz and Astros playroom is an amazing way to show off its capabilities plus load times r way faster. It's amazing .thank u amazon."
1577,tommy davis,2021,5,I like everything about it. Except the controller.
1578,Nigel Haris,2021,5,"As a console man this is the best thing I’ve ever played on. It has lightning fast load times and the best user interface I’ve ever seen in a Sony console. If you have access to it I suggest you buy it. Stop complaining if you couldn’t get one supply and demand, you don’t have to berate the console because you don’t understand how product releases work. This is nothing new to me as someone who deals with snkrs (laughing emoji) (laughing emoji) (laughing emoji)."
1579,Clem from NOLA,2021,5,"I got mine in on release day and have been enjoying it ever since, it's bigger than any other console I've owned so rather than sliding into the spot the PS4 sat in, I've got this next to my entertainment center with its cool white light lighting up an otherwise dark room.  There's a ton of potential for greatness this gen, even though there hasn't been many KILLER app games released yet."
1580,S. Wong,2021,1,"Hey, keep it up Sony with the crappy launch strategy.You're missing out on me and all my friends' and family's PS Plus subscriptions, and game purchases.You're missing out on multiplayer games actually having full lobbies.Your gaming studios will be losing users.I'm here to tell you messing up your console launch this badly will lose you a big big chunk of money."
1581,John sun,2021,5,"I like it so far, though the release was a hectic"
1582,juan,2021,5,Definetley worth the hype for the new PS5 after it came out almost 4 months ago
1583,Charles A Hatcher,2021,5,I preordered 2 PS5's one through Amazon and one through Playstation direct and they both came on launch day me and my boy have never been happier its so much faster and better in every way then the pS$ the only drawback at all so far has been the limited hard drive space i wish theyd update and allow us to put 3 or 4 TB SSD  but other then that this is a Gaming machine the likes of which the world has never seen before.
1584,drew whaley,2021,5,Awesome gaming system.. I bought the new Xbox Series X as well and I think the PS5 out performs the Xbox.
1585,Daniel Acabeo,2021,1,"Don't do it, my friends. Just hold off. Don't give in. As much as it's within your grasp, don't give in. There will be more genuine opportunities."
1586,Kawika,2021,1,"Patiently waiting for months, no PS5."
1587,andres,2021,1,Didn't work
1588,Samson,2021,1,I’ve been reading a couple of comment saying that the ps5 sells out to quick yea say thanks to the ps5 scalpers
1589,utefan,2021,5,"Don’t buy an Xbox, you deserve better. Leaps and bounds better. You won’t regret it"
1590,Verdug023,2021,5,"Great purchase, and the best was its price. The retail one. Good condition after the shipping and the waiting time was a little bit longer but since it is a hot item, was expected."
1591,Francisco Lopez,2021,5,Good
1592,Shelly Burris,2021,5,So I wasn’t able to get the ps5 for my son on Christmas because of all the bots.. I was very disappointed but my 15 year old understood.. But let me tell you when he opened that ps5 box he was so happy
1593,Gra.,2021,5,"Glad Amazon managed to get there hands on more stock, I was one of the lucky ones, they sold out in under a minute. The PS5 is great, the new controller is amazing."
1594,Amazon Customer,2021,5,The console runs practically flawlessly. It’s fast. It’s got great graphics. It’s been everything and more that I hoped it would be.
1595,Ricardo Colon,2021,5,Love the system get it if you don’t have one already.
1596,Roy  Correll,2021,5,"I love this! The DualSense doesn't feel like a normal controller and the games speed of download and online play are insane fast! Can't wait to see what more games and features to come!Update: 12/6/2021 In depth:I will sum up of not just the physical look but performance and play overall on M.2 SSD and PS5 SSD etcThe PS5 may look, depending on people preference, special in its own way but the futuristic look of the console is a breath opener for whats to come when powered on making a great, eye catching, for what awaitsThe Look: Personally, I love the look. Not only because its something new, but looks nex gen and more out of the current gen style. I seen lots of memes of being a heater, LOL funny, but the look works and better prepare on how different this console is from any other PS System ever played on before. The system shells even have mini carved printed Triangle, Square, Cross, and Circle symbol from the playstation controller as unique feel on the case as well. The stand, no matter side ways or standing, RECOMMEND using it as the stand helps support the weight, especially on Digital owners as the digital version weight is top heavy. However, I don't like their isnt many USB slots on the PS5 as, depending if using VR too with the PULSE Headset, can take all slots easily.Gameplay: The games gameplay appeal, even in remakes of PS3/PS4 titles take things to a whole new level as the new software of PS and the Hardware specs are almost that of a PC spec of a RTX GPU with separate options. The promo of Ray Tracing is gorgeous to look at, the colors, HDR, saturation and even real time render of the reflections, shadows, and in game particles make game lookes like a real live movie or in real life time itself. The separate options are Fidelty (which keeps ray tracing and real shadows and particles but in 4K to full quailty but in 30FPS) or Performance (Which doesnt have Ray tracing but in full 60fps and runs smoother than previous console of PS4, even on PS4 games looks much smooth with update of PS5 patches) on both PS5 games and even in the PS5 settings for anyone looking for a separate Ray tracing or true 60fps experiance. With or Without any Ray Tracing or HDR, games still look amazing no matter what screen size from a 1080p or 4K even in upcoming 8K (which have been tested and looks great on OLED UHD TVs.Memory: The PS5 Speed of its internal SSD is amazing for reducing loading times and almost instant to a dime, its even faster, depending on your M.2 SSD, Speed making its almost none existence thas even on PS4 games. For Digital Owners, I recommend save for M.2 thats up to 2TB to 4TB as some PS5 games are large but worth it with expanded SSD. The PS5 Internal 825GB is ok, but not enough, especially if recording video on PS5 or even trophy achievement videos. Thankfully, can disable the trophy achieve videos to only image. The recommend M.2 SSD is Gen4 6000m/s speed and M.2 Thermal casing for a good reason. Yes, you can do with lower speeds at some M.2 but I wouldnt recommend that. You can use HDD but only for PS4 games as PS5 games need SSDs for speed and size of game that runs on them than a SATA HDD.Fan/Cooling: Thankfully, this is the same issue as with PS4/PS4 Pro as the fan is silent no matter the settings and hard push for game quality. The fan is cool and quiet and even testing temperature doesn't get anywhere near hot as long in a open desk or spaced area.The Controller: The DualSense... is MORE than just a controller. The haptic feedback works too well to even call as vibration. The triggers weight for the feedback and feature of the controllers motion ALL shine in Astro's Playroom Demo on the PS5 and recommend for ANY PS fan as it is token for not just being a demo to showcase the controllers features, but secret messages and easter eggs too. Besides the haptic feed, the Touch Pad has had even a small upgrade as feel on it tracks and feel the feed through press or sliding on the touch pad on the DualSense, at least in games like Astro's Playroom and Demon Souls, whether through the character you are playing or even the environment for the feed back of the wind or the quake of the ground or weapons and abilities from the trigger buttons. I do hope more game developers fully use the DualSense features to their protentional.Backwards Compatibility: as of 12/6/2021, PS5 is completely backwards compatible with 99.9% of PS4 games, PSVR games as well, and works with PS5 DualSense controllers, but I recommend PS4 DualShock 4 Controller on some games though. PS Plan for more different service for a answer for more games from previous generation but we will have to wait, if I test out, will update the review here.Pros:-Can play MANY PS4 games, Disk or Digital out the box via your PSN Account-Great library, so far and the planned games ahead-DualSense is a GREAT next generation of gaming introduction into next gen of gaming in general-Fast loading and expansive storage for PS5 M.2 SSDs-PS5 can use HDD for PS4 games but still increase loading on most games that been updated through the patch (although not as fast than on PS5 or M.2 SSD)Cons:-Hard to get one if any because scalper bots-Is big and can take up lots of space depending on desk size-Not many USB slots on the console-Removing the cover shell of PS5, if impatient, can scratch the console a bit (but isnt damaging)"
1597,Thanos,2021,5,Very fast and great console I play call of duty Cold War and it looks and runs perfectly
1598,B. Yost,2021,5,Got it the day it was released! Amazon was a Godsend! Systems been on since we got it beyond a handful of times. No complaints at all! Thank you Amazon!
1599,PG,2021,1,"Its 2021 and still impossible to find. I have been on Team Playstation since the first Spyro game came out, but I'm getting sick and tired of trying to beat the bots and I think I will just get a Nintendo Switch instead."
1600,Trung Nguyen,2021,5,Dopest PlayStation console yet to be released color and graphic is on another level. The motion and sensitivity is crazy good
1601,Kevin Beemer,2021,5,I’m in love
1602,Pinksuzy,2021,5,My grandson loves his newPS5 .Graphics are amazing and he plays on it all the time.
1603,Adrienne Sturgeon,2021,5,"It's a really awesome game console. I actually really like the new UI, and the controller is a major step forward. I think the rumble is definitely something games can use in the future for things like lockpicking or creating environmental effects. If it's taken you a while to get one though, it won't be anything major you're missing out on. Games run a bit better, and load times are much shorter. But they're still the same games you know and love with the exception of a few that have been upgraded. It is really big, so definitely measure out where you want to put it. I ended up having to buy a little shelf on the fly because with the stand it didn't come close to fitting in my entertainment center. It's a great console, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops as more titles come out for it!"
1604,Adron,2021,2,It was great til it wasn’t. I was very impressed and loved playing my games. That is right up until the disc drive completely stopped working for no reason. After waiting on hold for a total of four hours over two calls I had to ship my PlayStation back to Sony. Somehow you must call them to set up repairs rather than online chat options like most other big companies. Now I sit and wait sans PlayStation. No biggie because they are so easy to find right?? No point in calling for updates with those wait times. Pretty disappointed with the whole process but when it works it’s definitely great
1605,Manuel Godoy,2021,5,"I live in Bolivia, and I thought that this product might arrive in 4 or 5 months, because of the distance; however, it arrived in one week to my house, that's awesome, and the product is terrific! Nice job."
1606,Tyler Featherson,2021,5,I love my PS5 everything worked good 💯💯💯💯

1615,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Love it! No complaints
1616,Alex,2021,5,It's a PS5.
1617,Ray,2021,5,Ps5 is amazing they went on sale in February again and I received it 2 days later. Loading times are amazing and game play is fun. Another Sony win
1618,Michael Goodrich,2021,3,A playstation 5 Should come with a bigger than a 825GB hard drive In this day and age  With game sizes getting bigger and bigger and the playstation pro had a 1TB hard drive The system should have 2TB at least The controller is great and sound the 3-D audio is amazing But playstation dropped the Ball on this and xbox also there should be no reason that they did not have enough copies of the systems for all the people for the holidays I waited 2 and a 1/2 months for this and I would say I'm glad to have it but I don't really care it's not that great I give it a 7.1 out of 10
1619,Dawtyn deyton,2021,5,Next gen is amazing
1620,Amazon Customer,2021,5,It’s lit!!!!!!!!!
1621,Jack Pliskin,2021,5,"I can’t begin to say how impressed i am with the PS5, the UI i so sleek and fast, load times are non existent (atleast on actual ps5 titles, playing Ps4 games do have to load but much faster than even the pro) the controller is ridiculously good and continues to blow my mind. This is a monumental leap for Playstation and Sony as a whole.Ps. Zero fan noise"
1622,Esaw Franco,2021,5,"Got one in the last drop, super lucky. Feels and looks way smoother than a ps5. Loads a ton faster. The UI took a bit to get used to and the game library isnt big yet but glad I finally got mine!"
1623,Skyler L,2021,5,Finally snagged one at 3 am!! It is definitely worth it! It lives up to the hype! I love it! I had been trying to get one since preorders in September
1624,KindHeart :),2021,5,I been HUNTING for a PS5 since nov 27th I didn’t pre order cause I was gonna wait til next year in 2022 but I couldn’t resist and so glad I didn’t wait and got it on February OMG the PS5 is AMAZING FAST and more beautiful when it’s in your hands I didn’t wanna open the box. I stayed up late nights and was losing lots of sleep for almost 3 months from trying to get one from a 3am drop but no luck I tried like 45 times from 4-5 different retailers but on my birthday month I scored from my FAVORITE AMAZON THANK U GUYS don’t give up keep trying. :) WOW I’m still in shock
1625,Jen,2021,5,"This is the best that Sony has every done.  I love this console, the look the way it runs and especially the controller.  They could have done nothing but added the controller and this would be worth it.  Amazing console tons of power and speed.  Can't wait to see what games come out to compliment the system."
1626,Heather Hubbell,2021,5,The graphics are amazing and load times are ridiculously fast. I love that you can migrate your HDD from the PS4 and play right away!
1627,Charlie Contreras,2021,5,Worked well and the checkout for this item went smoothly. Thanks!
1628,eric,2021,5,Powerful and amazing for the kids!
1629,craig s cotchan,2021,1,"“Play has no limits.” I wonder if Sony forgot about their limited supply of the Playstation 5.... They really should've thought the slogan through before releasing the console, considering their supply and demand limitations."
1630,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Sony PS5 Console/Controller are amazing as per 4K resolution and audio effects. it was a great effort to procure it finally after a long wait and add it to my Home Theater System. Thanks Amazon/Sony for getting me one finally. Very Compatible with Ps4/PS5?Digital/Built in Astro Bot Games.
1631,morghan,2021,5,What can I say PlayStation does it again great graphics and high resolution the controllers do get warm but that’s the controller not the console
1632,Dieverse,2021,5,"Very happy with it so far, 24 hours in and still getting to know this awesome machine. #TeamPlaystion"
1633,Ian,2021,5,I loved it so much because I resold it for money🤩🤩
1634,Lostinwoods,2021,5,"If you're into single player gaming like I am, then this was an automatic purchase. I was previously on a PS4 Pro.Performance is top notch and optimized, loading times what? Games are in constant development and look amazing. The console design is very unique and stands out. If you have a PS4 backlog you can enjoy those games here for now.Amazon delivered it in a big brown box, which was good. I highly recommend Sony PS5!"
1635,Dayo,2021,5,"Some next level stuff right here. The controller is strong & sturdy - like made from some reinforced plastic or something, but still light. If I had any *buts*, I'll say the PS5 is complex - so much going on. I miss the plug-n-play experience of the PS2."
1636,Craig Atkinson,2021,5,I had to get the PS5.
1637,Black Bear,2021,5,Amazing console. Blows Xbox out of the water. This one officially ended the console wars !
1638,Earl,2021,5,"Truly next gen gaming experience having used a launch Xbox One for the past 7 years. It’s all about the controller. I love using it combined with the PS app, I didn’t realize how convenient it would be to purchase a game and start the download from my phone so it’s installed and updated when I’m ready to play. Shipping said 3-5 days but I got mine in 1 one the east coast. Don’t buy from a reseller and wait for a restock. Worth every penny and all the attempts. Thank you Amazon and Sony!"
1639,Ibrahim Callwood,2021,5,The console is amazing. Been playing Spider-Man Miles Morales on Performance RT and it plays beautifully. So glad I was finally able to get my hands on one.
1640,Joshua Martinez,2021,5,I already have a PC but I wanted a PS5 just to flex and play 60fps PS games. Pretty lucky I got one though.
1641,Juan V,2021,3,Finally after several months I got mine. I’m super happy about and what else can I say I love the ps5. The graphics looks amazing
1642,Jake farley,2021,5,Fast shipping great product

1645,MICHAELÁ,2021,5,I have been trying to get my hands on one since Nov so excited
1646,John Pascual,2021,5,Best System in the world.
1647,Joe B,2021,5,"Amazing graphics, quick load times and super quiet! The only knock is it’s huuuge!"
1648,Aubrey Foster,2021,4,"It’s Amazing, fast, runs very well. Worth the trouble, in my opinion."
1649,Tyson Fitzgerald,2021,5,"This is an amazing console, I make about $300 on each one reselling them, amazing!"
1650,Christian Garcia,2021,5,It was a huge upgrade from ps4 to ps5 once you see the gameplay you can’t go back
1651,Zain,2021,5,Thanks Amazon for the 3:30 AM  Surprise unexpected Drop. Without Jake Randal I wouldn't have done that💙🙏💛
1652,Amador,2021,1,It's truly sad how horrible this launch is going because of scum scalpers
1653,David ,2021,5,"I've been playing it for some weeks already and it has been working just fine. Games like Demon's Souls and Miles Morales run flawlessly,  load screens are practically gone for those two. The fan is very quiet.I've got a couple of game crashes (3 that I remember) but nothing too serious so far.Very excited for all the upcoming games this generation will bring."
1654,Milky Jay,2021,5,Nothing to dislike...at all.
1655,Roger,2021,5,"In Joy though ;) The specs on this console, paired with my 1440P monitor, is light years ahead of my PS4 Pro."
1656,Uriel mercado,2021,5,"Super fast, looks amazing!"
1657,Seth Whitmire,2021,5,"It's worth the wait, don't give into the scalpers. I know it's hard but follow ps5 restock on Twitter and that's your best way. That's what I did in the latest Amazon drop. Normally I was to slow at it but this time I was able to get one."
1658,chris,2021,5,Precious...
1659,mike,2021,3,Well that's great. Paid full price for the digital version. The messed up part is I can't return it without buying something else in exchange. I'm pissed.Update 2/22/2021: disk drive works now. Somehow it fixed itself. Weird. Changed to 3 stars from 1. Minus 2 because it’s still a little fickle and because you can’t return for a full refund. You have to exchange for something from a list of things amazing chooses for you.
1660,John,2021,4,Amazing console and glad I was able to snag one in which I can play my PS4 games. Sadly it does not have many games out that are exclusive. Really fast loading and great FPS but gaming got boring fast again because it’s just the same games as before for now. Definitely worth to buy however
1661,Bluedude31,2021,5,10/10
1662,Alvis,2021,5,Great awesome
1663,Justin Lopez,2021,5,Came fast and good it only took three days and this ps5 is very fun.
1664,Taylor ,2021,5,"Was able to snag this on Monday morning randomly, it was delivered 3 days later! Definitely worth the wait!"
1665,Amazon Customer,2021,5,What I like about this product is amazing  it’s a new gen console so far so good the controller of this is fantastic
1666,Darth Spartan,2021,5,Love the PS5 its awesome. So far all the games I have played look and play great. No issues.
1667,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Fiya
1668,De A.,2021,5,"I got it at the right time, from the right place, and for the right price. The console is great and more than worth the hype. I just wish there were more multi-player to a console games."
1669,Mohammed Ridha Abdulmonnem,2021,5,My setup and next Generation in the house ❤️ It’s too hard to secure one hope it will be easier to get it in the future
1670,brian gibson,2021,5,This was unexpected but this ps5 came early 👍🏽 during a snowstorm thanks Amazon and USPS for their timely delivery
1671,Sollo,2021,1,Not worth the wait
1672,M,2021,5,I just nutted
1673,PeterNguyen,2021,5,Unbelievably I got one on launch day. Looks great...works great
1674,Dorothea C. Belcher,2021,5,Love it. My son loved it. The graphics are great. Easy setup. Shipped fast. It's much bigger than the PS4 though!
1675,David,2021,5,Great price!thanks a lot
1676,Chance Murray,2021,4,"Got from the 02/16/2021 Amazon restock by using the “HotStock” app.Honestly, I’m having mixed feelings on this console so far. It’s quiet, it’s fast and the controller really wowed me with the built in mic and the haptic feedback. The 20 titles in the “PS Collection” that came for free with the PSplus membership is really nice, especially for those like me who traded in the majority of their PS4 things. Unfortunately, the graphics so far haven’t impressed me too much. Playing on the same 4K 60hz tv my PS4 slim was on and I really cannot tell the difference. Maybe getting a new display and hitting 120fps would make a noticeable difference, but I’m not going to spend the money to find out any time soon. The 650ish GBs worth of usable space on the SSD quickly vanished after installing 4 Ps5 titles and the PS4 copy of CyberPunk. Had to delete a few demos to make room. I understand Sony plans on offering more storage options in the future, but as of right now space is already an issue with only 5 disc games. This console is also HUGE. It makes my Xbox series S look like a model toy. The design of the console also isn’t very visually appealing. I’m sure some hotshot engineer/designer had some reasons for making it curvy and giving it a popped collar look at the top, but I feel like it isn’t necessary and could’ve easily been made smaller without sacrificing airflow or heat dissipation. I travel for work, and getting this thing in my carry on luggage safely is going to be a challenge. The game lineup (Ps5 only exclusives) right now isn’t too great, although I’m sure that’ll change closer to the end of 2021. After putting in all this effort to get my hands on one since preorders were announced, I honestly feel like it’s all just been hyped up thanks to scarce stock. For those still trying to get their hands on one, I don’t see the big rush in trying to upgrade until more games are released and Sony makes memory expansion for PS5 titles available. As of right now, it’s a PS4 pro with a fancy controller 🙃"
1677,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Controller and load times is the biggest upgrade. It may seem small..but definitely worth the money.I actually broke my hdmi port, contacted Sony, they sent me a new one. So from the day it broke, to receiving my new ps5 it was 3 days total..nothing out of pocket."
1678,jose,2021,5,Greatest thing ever
1679,78LSXMONTE,2021,5,Best playstation ever plays fast smooth and amazing graphics.
1680,Israel Figueroa,2021,1,UNIT APPEARS TO BE TAMPERED WITH
1681,Mr. Regular Guy,2021,5,Best console on the market. Don’t leave a review if you didn’t get one! PC gamers too worried about the latest hardware they don’t get a chance to enjoy the games. Seems like they lost the point as they explain why they think they are better.
1682,Michael P,2021,5,"I like the new menu features of the playstation 5 console, gameplay is amazing, downloading and installing games are much faster."
1683,Patricia L. Schambach,2021,5,My son loves it
1684,felicita portillo,2021,2,have no negative comments just saw that no one gave 2 stars
1685,Kasey parker,2021,5,Love my ps 5. Had its issues at first but now with the few updates it has had now. It works great for me.
1686,Matthew,2021,1,"Annoyed...Getting one of these shouldn't be a game...Wasted my time, no productivity, just wasted...Lost time...Been on since ps1, Atari...edit 6.22.21: Still Annoyed, just now have wasted more time..."
1687,ShadowYYZ,2021,5,"Got lucky in December, awesome for solo player games. As a huge fan of the souls series, this was the only reason why I switched. Also, throughout the years of having both owned an xbox and a ps console. I noticed I would play most if not all the exclusives compared to xbox. The graphics are what you expect and the new controller is a winner. This feels like the futuristic way to go. I recommend to try this out even if you are from the other side."
1688,Amazon1Hunter,2021,1,I will continue to play and enjoy my AMD PC and PS4.
1689,Kevin,2021,1,"it literally would not work for me the first 2 days, and it started to work after those days but the same problem is coming back.."
1690,Timothy Williams,2021,5,Just glad I was able to get my hands on one!!
1691,Austin,2021,5,I been having a lot of fun with my PS5. Its really great and I hope everyone can enjoy it soon
1692,Amazonian,2021,4,The system is solid but not perfect.  I'm constantly looking for new games to play because there isn't much available.  Just be patient and you'll eventually get one. Do yourself a favor and don't pay too much for it.
1693,mikuel,2021,5,"This console is awesome checkout was quick and easy. Yes the launch was bad but I’m reviewing the product itself and the ps5 is a great console I can see why a lot of people want one so bad. And because I managed to get one after a couple months, software updates have already came out so the UI runs smooth. I haven’t ran into  any software bugs as of yet. Launch titles are sparse but the backwards compatibility it’s a really good feature so no need to rebuy your PS4 games on nextgen."
1694,Rick W,2021,5,"Everyone complains there aren’t enough of them which I get, but, on the release date they had more available than the ps4 did on its release day.. plus the processing / gaming chip are equivalent to about a $1000 gaming pc so everyone needs to stop complaining. Sony is doing everyone a favor and not raising prices to what they absolutely should be. Kudos to Sony for doing the right thing and keeping an amazing product for a very reasonable price compared to what they easily could sell it for. Hope everyone gets theres soon."
1695,G snyder,2021,5,"Amazing product, well worth the money and time spent tracking it down!"
1696,Troy cotton,2021,1,I am done trying to order this PlayStation 5 i’ve been to every website mouse store outlets and still cannot purchase this item I’ve had my money saved up for months now yes still not able to purchase it I think I will just purchase me a good gaming PC and be done with it it’s not worth it Sony is playing with our emotions by letting these resellers purchase these consuls and resell it to us at a higher price and I for one am done with it they can keep the PS5 because a good gaming PC is much better anyway
1697,Fish64,2021,5,Finally got it!!!! This thing is awesome. The controller is great. Love it
1698,DN,2021,5,Just as expected. The design is so different from the older systems but you get used to it.
1699,Christopher Lolo,2021,5,Fast and smooth better launch titles than the series x as well. The only thing I dislike still is PSN.
1700,Sael,2021,5,Product is fast and reliable. Games are great so far. Everything I could dream of!
1701,Jeremy Yorke,2021,5,Amazing
1702,Haleigh,2021,5,A dream of a console
1703,Gaston Azubel-Goldstein,2021,5,Works beautifully
1704,Tony Garcia Alfaro,2021,5,It’s worth it
1705,Jessy,2021,5,Fast shipping. Product as described! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
1706,R3dbrut3,2021,5,Amazing console! The graphics are stellar and the loading speed is very good. Makes all my other PS4 games look even better. For example RDR2 graphics will blow you away even more on the PS5! I highly recommend it if you can get your hands on one.
1707,Bubba,2021,5,I love my ps5
1708,Sam Bischoff,2021,5,"One of these days I will check this page and it will be in stock, until then, 5 stars"
1709,Osmany Del Sol,2021,5,"It does suck when a lot of people bought all the stocks and resold them but other than that if you do manage to get your hands on one, its a great console. Ive been enjoying mine and haven’t had any issues, its soo much fun !"
1710,David Cruz,2021,5,"It came in on time on the week of release with no damage at all, to the system or the box GoW2 here I come"
1711,Tyler Christeson,2021,5,Great product. Arrived on time. No damages on arrival.
1712,Honeydew,2021,5,Great PS5
1713,Joel Velez,2021,5,"What can I say, I love my PS5. Its quiet, it's fast, it's delivering in everything they advertised so far. The UI could improve a little but this is just the beginning of this gen, so I'm sure it will happen eventually."
1714,K,2021,1,It is absolutely ridiculous and complete bs that this console is impossible to find so long after release. What a terrible rollout and disservice to their fans. I expected so much better
1715,Shawn W.,2021,4,"I’m just going to review the system and not the nightmare ordering process. I was lucky enough to get a pre-order in at another retailer.Like everyone says: It’s big. I’m including a photo of it next to a PS4 Pro. It’s almost too big for my entertainment console and it makes me a little nervous being so crammed in there, but it hasn’t overheated.The system can be loud at times. I didn’t expect that. The disc drive can also be loud at times. I would think by 2020, we’d have pretty quiet disc drives, but apparently not. Luckily it’s usually just in short bursts.I’ve had no hardware issues at all with it. WiFi speed is much improved over the PS4, but I also don’t use the PS for app steaming. I have another device for that.As for the software, that’s why I am taking off a star. The OS is just too busy. It’s filled with a bunch of junk I don’t care about. The PS4 OS was very basic and largely unchanged from PS3, yes; however, I like simplicity. I wish in future updates it was simplified and cleaned up a little. I don’t want to see links to game news or videos on my home screen.Game-wise, there aren’t too many games right now that are worth playing. So if you still can’t get one (and please don’t pay/reward a scalper), you aren’t missing a lot. AC Valhalla looks like it could be on PS4. Miles Morales really shows off the almost-zero loading times, but could still be a PS4 game as the original Spider Man was already a visually amazing. You’re not missing out on anything cutting edge at this point.Long story short: Yeah, the roll out was awful. The system is holding up after 4 months so far. It can be a bit noisy. The OS could be cleaned up and simplified some. The really good games are still to come, so don’t fret if you can’t yet get one."
1716,Riku Asakura,2021,5,I love the PS5! Next-gen gaming is here and I am proud to admit that I own one now
1717,Justin Gerbino,2021,5,Makes the ps4 feel like a toaster
1718,J'Micah Wilson,2021,5,Great. Appreciate amazon for the purchase
1719,Rawand Farhad,2021,5,A PS5 🔥
1720,Maurice Henry,2021,5,"When I was finally able to get one, I had no complaints."
1721,christopher,2021,5,🔥🔥🔥🌟✨⭐️
1722,Brandy R Cassidy,2021,5,"I was sooo excited when these dropped, I was able to put it in my cart an hit checkout! Was trying to get the ps5 for 2 weeks! Ordered it 12/29 an recieved it 12/31!! It was a late Xmas gift for my son,he’s VERY happy!"
1723,Anthony Heredia,2021,1,"We’ve been waiting all of 2020 to get a PS5, and for one retailer to drop the ball, and then mess it up not to mention Sony dropped the ball as well. I’m a healthcare worker, and day in & day out I deal with patients 10+ hours a day, and looking forward to getting a console, and just not being able to when people use bots etc to get them is just depressing."
1724,J.C.,2021,5,Amazing platform
1725,Steve,2021,1,"I have a PS4 Pro with VR and many accessories.  Because of the terrible, greedy launch of the PS5, I have decided to not buy one until I can get a used one for half the price a year from now."
1726,Shadi,2021,5,Good flip
1727,Kevin Del Cid,2021,4,"I like the console overall, just hard to get hands on one."
1728,hector,2021,1,"I'm just glad to see so many reviews with very smart people not falling for this brainwash garbage, it's all a system that is been created, there's more to this, than so many don't understand."
1729,Cary Gephart,2021,1,This is F-/:ing stupid. I had one in my cart and by the time I got the card number in it was gone. Sony definitely got this release wrong. Great system and that controller function is badass.
1730,Matt,2021,5,Awesome!!! I was ecstatic to finally get a PS5 and it arrived in 2 days! Game changer and well worth the price.
1731,Joseph Kopel,2021,1,One of the many reasons why I love humanity but I CANT stand people!! And by people I meant abusers taking advantage of others...
1732,Zahir,2021,5,"Worth the money, glad I lucked up and got it"
1733,Amazon Customer,2021,5,"Fast Shipping, Great Customer Service"
1734,Ryan,2021,1,"20+ year customer switching to PC. Way to go PlayStation, hope it was worth it."
1735,Nathan gray,2021,5,Just pure amazing the gameplay is awesome the haptic feedback and visuals are stunning also games like spiderman miles and original ps4 remaster AMAZING!!! this is deffinately worth it even though there hard to get
1736,Amanda Garcia,2021,5,I was waiting at different Walmart’s overnight for weeks! Luckily my brother decided to check Amazon randomly one night and I was able to get one for my boyfriend for Christmas. It also arrived super quickly and in time for gifts
1737,J. M. Wilkinson,2021,5,The PlayStation 5 is pretty great. We currently only use this for gaming.
1738,Mark R. Moore,2021,1,"Artificial scarcity so demand is indefinitely sky high.  No thanks, not worth the bs."
1739,Amazon Customer,2021,5,I love this  console I feel really bad for those not able to purchase one without having to go through some third-party retailer it’s really messed up how all of this started but for the most part my experience with it so far has been amazing although I really hope more people are able to find one at retail price well hopefully everyone stays safe and hopefully everyone who is attempting to get one can get one because it’s an amazing product for the Play station brand
1740,Chris Martin,2021,5,Absolutely love my new console! I know they have been so difficult to find since launch but the PS5 is totally worth it! Amazing value with PS plus library !
1741,Daniel Perez,2021,5,"This product will not disappoint. Just like previous consoles, this console will provide the same great gaming experience as the PlayStation lineage has."
1742,Amazon Customer,2021,5,It is awesome. Fast loading times.
1743,James,2021,1,it has been months and the stupid thing is still only available from third party sellers. this is the worst launch in game console history. make the thing available to people for heavens sake!
1744,Ber,2021,1,Only pro gamers and streamers got the and the pre orders for everyone else sold out instantly. Sony knew there was a pandemic and customers wanted this console bad yet they made hardly any and haven't since! Sony needed to wait until they had enough for the majority of their customers. Even since its launch I haven't seen a single version for the correct price. This was criminal Sony Playstation!
1745,tarek aziz,2021,5,Awesome experience! Thanks amazon prime for super quick next day shipping! ❤️❤️
1746,Gwen<3'sBooks,2021,1,"If you can't get one to play it, you have to rate it a zero.All these negative reviews who are citing the irregular and incomprehensible lack of consoles, yet the phony Amazon rating is a full 5 stars?Seems like more disinformation to me. Shame."
1747,Paul Taglialatela,2021,5,I love it!!
1748,sully,2021,5,Great buy. Amazon delivery service was great. One of the best new consoles released. Very pleased with my order and how smooth it was to purchase.
1749,Clift,2021,5,This is an awesome system I have really been enjoying it.
1750,gerry williams,2021,1,Order 3 for my company the stuff is used had been open had zip lock bags with the charging cords for controllers stuff not put back in the box horrible dont order from them. It is advertised like it is new. The charging cords with one of the ps5 is not even a type c cord its like a charging cord for ps4.
1751,terra,2021,5,
1752,Nadim,2021,5,Ahead of its time. Love this thing so much.
1753,WLlewelyn,2021,5,Hubs loves his late gift and the whole family has been playing it.
1754,Mike Platel,2021,5,It's a playstation.
1755,E,2021,5,Great graphics great games
1756,Ivanna,2021,5,I like it!
1757,HAWKS!,2021,5,All of it! I’ve been playing Sony for almost 45 years. I would not buy any other product. I’m extremely happy that this system has arrived. My mother passed away on the 4th of July and this system came at a time that keeps my mind pre-occupied and not think about my mother being gone for a couple hours a day. So Thank you Sony for all the wonderful years of playing video games.
1758,Mariah Clyde,2021,5,"Playstation 5 is awesome! Works great, thanks for fast delivery."
1759,Chengzhangz Li,2021,5,"Thank you amazon, I have been looking for this more than 2 month, finally copped one. thank uuuuu"
1760,Klus12,2021,5,This thing is huge
1761,Soundcastle,2021,2,"Worked for about a week, now it won't boot, even into safe mode. Flashes blue lights forever, even after unplugging for 20+ minutes as advised, as well as a number of other troubleshooting steps involving AC power and HDMI connections.Now I have to send it for repairs with an expected turnaround of 10-15 business days after they ship me a return box in the next 3-5 business days.Prior to this I would say the biggest draw of the PS5 so far is the DualSense controller with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.Unfortunately there are only a handful of native PS5 games to even take advantage of those features.Coming from a non-Pro PS4 playing some PS4 games at higher frame rates and/or upscaled resolution was another enjoyable part of the console."
1762,Henry Perla,2021,5,Really great console
1763,Enrique2009,2021,5,What can I say ? It’s a PS5...  it’s just awesome!!!
1764,Juan V,2021,5,"Had a rocky start, but with more system updates it has become a more stable console.. think of it as the upgrade to the ps4"
1765,Jamee J,2021,3,I had to return due to technical issues. Bugs galore.
1766,Sathvik,2021,5,Looks amazing !!!
1767,Lea McMannen,2021,5,this product was brand new and had no issues with it.
1768,Anthony Moreno,2021,5,Love it.
1769,Rashaad Turpin,2021,5,Came packaged properly and no issues
1770,Joseph,2021,5,"Its nice, new and such but honestly I'm waiting for vulneribilities to appear so I can take fuller advantage of PS5. Literally the only reason why I got my hands on one from the jump."
1771,kathy quintard,2021,5,Early delivery. Just as promised
1772,CSJJB,2021,5,"Amazing, worth the wait for those who haven’t gotten one yet. DO NOT PAY MORE THAN RETAIL PRICE($499). Before you know it they’ll be easy to get and paying double will be something you wish you didn’t do. Love the feel of the controller, graphics are fantastic and games load much faster than the 4."
1773,Mark Chavez,2021,5,This is the BEST PlayStation EVER!!!!!!
1774,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Love it!
1775,Skolar702,2021,5,Great
1776,Howard Wei,2021,5,Like the console
1777,George Henin,2021,5,Great system. This was honestly the easiest way I got a ps5.
1778,Efrain C.,2021,5,was able to get this one and a digital version for my boys. product as describe and the PS5 is a solid console.
1779,T.K. Tatum,2021,5,Love Love Love! Everything about it is great and the graphics are so amazing it looks like you could walk right into the game.
1780,Jerrod S.,2021,5,This is awesome I'm glad I got it day 1
1781,Ken Compton,2021,5,"Not going to write a long review, but if you are on the fence, just get it, it is very next gen nice.I am going to have to get another one, since I can't get any time on it."
1782,Adam koper,2021,5,Great product
1783,Austin Le,2021,5,This thing is such a huge upgrade from the ps4 base to the ps5 you’ll not regret dropping 500$ for this. Very big size difference the base is sturdy and will not make your ps5 fall over unless you force it to fall down.
1784,EDDIE,2021,5,Ps5 all there is to say
1785,Brian DaSilva,2021,5,Great
1786,Jorge guillen,2021,5,Its good
1787,Tatyann Bent,2021,5,Worth it
1788,Ahmad Elhajomar,2021,5,Got lucky with this one. Got it for $499 disc . Love it super hard to get will worth it . Amazon shipping next day no extra charge . Love it good lucky getting one
1789,LaChelle Haywood,2021,5,Thank you AMAZON for completing my son's Christmas list
1790,Saurabh Tanna,2021,5,Was lucky enough to find it on amazon! Loving it so far!
1791,Ratana Ly,2021,5,"Very difficult to get, but was so worth it! Excited to play all of the new games to come!"
1792,Jake Passafiume,2021,1,The console crashes all the time. Over heats when ever I use it. Frame rate sucks. Demons souls is only quad hd 60fps and 4k 30fps. Sony advertising as 4k 120fps
1793,KWB&BAB,2021,5,"Absolutely stunning console! I was trying hard for about a week to snag one, and Amazon was by far the easiest checkout process to do so. Those of you who are trying and trying—don’t give up!! The console is definitely worth the work, and it’ll be great for years to come."
1794,Corbin,2021,4,Solid console. Don’t see much difference from the ps4 but hey. I got one lol.
1795,Elkins Lorenzo,2021,5,I love it 😍
1796,Kelton,2021,5,Amazing.
1797,Will_Marty,2021,5,"Buy if you can, won’t regret it!"
1798,Terry,2021,5,"Finally got my PS5!  Everything I imagined and more.  Going from a basic PS4 to this has been a dream.  Playing Cyberpunk and Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order with a stable 60fps is beyond awesome.  MK 11 plus the other 2 games I mentioned load so incredibly fast.My Pros:- The best controller I've ever held in my hands.  Guys/Gals with big hands will fall in love with this controller.- The battery life feels like it last forever.  Nice to have your controller running for hours without having to worry about a charge.- Menu is easy to navigate and I love the UI.  Just sucks there arent any themes yet.  Hope they get added down the line!- Was very happy and pleasantly surprised when I could hook up the stand for my SkullCandy PLYR 1 headset and they worked like a charm and still sounded great.  Made sure to turn off 3D audio because that headset doesnt have that feature.- This system is beautiful.  Some people hate it but I fell in love with the design.Cons:Really, my only complaint is that this system is huge lol and I didnt fully understand when people said this until I got mine.  Definitely a big boy.  Not really a negative for me but if I had to complain about something that's it.Extra info:Was delivered in pristine condition.  No dents or dings even on the outside box.  Also I heard that some had issues with the sleep mode.  I've had none.  Not saying it doesnt exsist but personally I have had no problems with it.  However i have heard about people with external hard drives that have an issue with putting your PS5 in sleep mode with the external hard drive attached.  Dont have any info on that but I would look up info on the subject just to be on the safe side of things.  Havent tested the haptic feedback yet, so I cant give my thought on that yet.I'm completely satisfied with this purchase and it went beyond my expectations."
1799,Big Butler,2021,5,Not a gamer but I am having fun gaming on this thing. Get one if and when you can.
1800,Nicolas M.,2021,4,I’m not gonna be bias on this review but overall everything was perfect except my order got delayed for Uncontrollable reasons. It wasn’t hard to get from Amazon so that was good.
1801,Leonardo Canela,2021,5,Ps5 can’t believe finally got it my whole family love it now I see why is a lot hype totally worth it in my opinion can’t wait for all new games coming out.
1802,Shawn,2021,5,Great
1803,Linda Farrell,2021,5,"Despite all the resellers and waiting months, I finally secured one early in the morning. Out of all the sites, amazon was by far the easiest. Love how fast everything load & how clear the games are compared to the ps4."
1804,Jean-Baptiste family,2021,5,Amazon is the best! So easy to secure and fast delivery!!!
1805,Jason Rodriguez,2021,5,"It’s a pretty fun console to play on, a pretty good forward step to next generation, even though this the very first mode you’ll experience buzzing while you play with a disc."
1806,Xavier,2021,5,Love My Ps5!!Thanks Amazon
1807,Walker Nash,2021,5,Great console

1810,Beau,2021,3,Love the ps5 but isn’t worth the hype
1811,albert cruz,2021,5,This thing was so hard to find .. but once I set it up with my new sony tv .. omg game changer ..looks amazing 👍👍👍👍
1812,Fredy Hernandez,2021,5,Purchase on release day & came the day after. I’ve enjoyed since. (Spiderman is a must!)
1813,Sam Su,2021,5,"It's worth the hype. 4K 60 fps is legit. It's wild to me that this is a reality and the backwards compatibility is FANTASTIC. The controller is for sure the real deal and to feel the haptic feed back, I'm just excited for the future."
1814,JB,2021,5,Extremely happy with the quick delivery and quality of the product
1815,Zehbil,2021,5,"Got lucky, had a stock tracker. Got a notification and checked out in about three seconds. One day shipping so I got it immediately next day within 24 hours. Console looks and runs amazing. Really good step up from the PlayStation 4. I’ve owned every PlayStation and I’m never let down."
1816,DJai,2021,5,love this console
1817,Aaron Fajardo,2021,5,Best piece of technology you can have as of now.
1818,Altoh khadka,2021,5,"After bunch of sleepless night and countless try , I was finally able to get these thanks to amazon for such a easy process. I love everything about this console . Its the best I ever played on and I can't wait to try new games !!!!!"
1819,Kyle B,2021,5,Loving the new console. Highly recommended.
1820,jesse ,2021,5,I love it!  So glad I got my hands on this console for retail price... I LOVE YOU AMAZON.  Xbox series x has nothing on this!!!
1821,Wesley,2021,5,i have been trying since September and amazon came in clutch it is so perfect and i am happy i finally got it

1825,Jamie Lazarian,2021,5,I am so relieved to have bought this at regular price. And amazon delivered same day! I have been trying for weeks! Thank you. It’s awesome.
1826,Seth M Noar,2021,5,"playstation really outdid themselves with this console. the controller is incredible, the load speeds are unimaginable, everything about this console is great. but i will say this, if you are looking for an on the road all the time type of console that's easily portable, then it isn't for you. this thing is absolutely massive and cannot be moved very easily. the user interface is absolutely gorgeous and the redesign that playstation has brought into this system is magnificent. one very slight issue i've had with mine is sometimes after i've turned it off it'll make these little popping noises, but that hasn't affected it in any way shape or form. absolutely recommend to the everyday gamer."
1827,Konrad Patrzalek,2021,4,"I got this because I wanted something new, and next gen. I also wanted to play cyber punk, but turns out the game is hot garbage for the game. My PS5 is constantly locking up, especially when I play spiderman, if the system goes to sleep while paused, I will have to retart and rebuild. Gets kinda annoying maybe it will be good once they get the kinks out."
1828,Rusty Shaklefold,2021,5,Very excited. All the haters are mad that bots are faster.
1829,Josh,2021,5,easy set up
1830,Theo M.,2021,5,"Had this console for a little over 2 weeks and it’s a great console. Comparing to the PS4 Pro it’s miles faster, cooler and quieter. Sony didn’t cut corners with this console in any way and it runs perfectly fine. Although this console has good things it also has some negative things. In order to use this console to its max you need a 4k, HDR10, and 120Hz tv/monitor. It is useless when if you are considering to play anything less than that. Currently I’m on HDR, 4K, but 60Hz and In games like Cold War (PS5 Version), the frames tend to drop when the game is at its stressful moments. RTX and other graphical improvements aren’t groundbreaking because it’s a cod game but it’s definitely noticeable on other games like Spider-Man: Miles Morales. I was running it at 60FPS in its highest setting and never seemed to go below 55. Lastly if you are moving from a base PS4 or Base Xbox it’s a night and day difference going from 720p-1080p all the way to 4K 120Hz gameplay. If you had a Xbox One X or a PS4 pro you won’t see many differences in terms of graphical advances but that isn’t a bad thing. I haven’t ran into any issues yet with this console so i can’t speak how good it is long term. Finally the console is huge. Way bigger than the base Xbox One and I can barely fit it at the spot I have it in. Not sure why Sony thought to make such a bug machine since the Series X is more powerful yet smaller. It is beautiful though not going to lie. Great Console!"
1831,Kasey Walker,2021,1,Not in this life time.  Buyers please don’t buy from these sharks
1832,Hector D. Chavez,2021,1,Not playing double!

1834,Brian,2021,1,"Thankfully, I secured a ps5 and didn’t have to pay these scalpers a dime. It’s not worth more than 400 to 500 people, it really isn’t worth it. Trust me, you’ll regret spending over  $500 for this"
1835,Amazon Customer,2021,1,I’ll just keep playing my 4! Play all 30 of your systems! 🤣🤣🤣🤣

1854,Ricardo Palacios jr,2021,5,Powerful good looking system
1855,Chef,2021,1,"straight evil.And if you're one of those purchasing the ps5 at this price, it's your fault too.I haven't bought one yet, as i am waiting for it to restock at regular price.At this rate, I may as well just save my money for the next console..Too much hype.Too many abusers."
1856,A Chan,2021,5,Everyone knows what you’re getting into when deciding on a console. Check out the console exclusives and see if they’re the ones you want to play
1857,Henry,2021,1,It gave a frikin  toy
1858,Zia Khwaja,2021,4,I love the new console from sony. Super fast load times and almost no bugs. The new UI system is a bit different but it will take some time to get used to. Other than that great buy!
1859,David,2021,5,"Great console, great graphics, great frame rate. Everything about it is great and I’m grateful to have gotten the PS5 and upgrading from a loud jet in my room. The most amazing thing about this console is it’s QUIET!"
1860,Wood,2021,5,Great
1861,Shane Tang,2021,5,i ordered from pre-order period. it arrived on time.i played cyberpunk 2077 on it. great controller!
1862,veritech_13,2021,5,I received this 2 days after i ordered it. The graphics are amazing and the design is very large but that does not bother me.  AMAZING NEXT GEN GAMING!
1863,Amazon Customer,2021,5,The best next gen console to get. Runs beautifully with no issues. Can’t wait for the next god of war and horizon!!!
1864,James Altgilbers,2021,5,PS5 Exclusives are the reason I went with the PS5. Great new console for the kids.
1865,Alexis Bruno,2021,5,"I love everything about the next generation of consoles. The PS5 is the beat console I’ve owned. I’ve always been a PlayStation guy and my love for the company grows even more with this one. The load times are almost nothing now and the controller. The controller is the best part about it, the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback just give it that next gen feel. Amazon was very careful with my delivery and it arrived earlier than expected and no damage on the box."
1866,Cheng-Yu Chiang,2021,5,The quality of this console is very good and the design is about right. I enjoyed it so much and the delivery was fast too.
1867,CJ,2021,1,This is some bs 😒 🙄 😑 smh how a 500.00 game cost 1199.00 come on Amazon
1868,Zachary,2021,1,Would rather wait for more stock to come up then pay double. !
1869,Brush,2021,5,Awesome
1870,Hassan Khan,2021,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE
1871,Terrance Griffith,2021,1,I would rather watch your hold on total amount playstation 5 console as more playstation 5 console becomes available later on.
1872,Rafi,2021,5,Nice
1873,Dean R. ,2021,5,"Love the layout design, sleek feel too it. Also the adaptive triggers are pretty cool new feature. Runs smooth and quiet. I have both The Xbox Series X and PS5 and currently the Xbox Series X seems better. Especially playing Warzone, does not have a input lag ( responds time to your console from pressing a button on your controller). This is very much needed to have the slightest advantage when in a shoot out. It’s like who ever pulls the trigger first wins and you can notice the Ps5 doesn’t pick it up as fast as the Xbox. That’s because the Xbox runs warzone at 120fps and  The Ps5 at 60fps on warzone. The Ps5 was not able to update it like the Xbox because it has issues upgrading last gen games because of their limited backward compatibility options. Which sucks. Cuz all I really play at the moment is warzone. Hopefully they fix it in the near future."
1874,Cbaker,2021,5,"Once you can get it, you won’t regret it!"
1875,J. Merrill,2021,1,"So far, the system has been terrible. More bugs and errors than ever before."
1876,Chaturanga Manchanayake,2021,5,"I pre-ordered during September, right after the launch and I am so happy with the console. I am just waiting on Sony to update the system or to announce when to expand the internal storage cause it's the only problem I am having right now. Also Amazon was very friendly and sent my console right on time so I gotta play my  favourite games on my B'day."
1877,Siraj,2021,5,i love it
1878,Tim,2021,2,"Not sure if it’s the PlayStation itself or Sony’s PS5 network, but my PS5 constantly has issues connecting to the internet. My wifi is not the issue. My PS4 and all other devices connect without issues."
1879,Jesus Torrealba,2021,5,Is perfect
1880,Jewun L. Hazel,2021,5,On cloud 9 excellent video game
1881,WindFishTokes,2021,5,"Arrived on time, and in great condition. Kept updated via the website to ensure someone would be home to get the package off the porch to avoid thievery. The box was pristine, the system works great- no issues. Husband loved the surprise! The preordering fiasco is one memory I'll never forget."
1882,Bruce Wang,2021,5,"This is my first playstation console, and as a PCMasterRace veteran this console has been wonderful.I bought this because I no longer have the time to upgrade, and manage my PC to play all the latest games, and I also wanted to play the Sony exclusives such as God of War, Uncharted,  Spiderman,  and Last Of Us.The only thing I wish Sony did better was build more co-op games so that I can enjoy it with my significant other, for now that role is exclusive to my Switch.My only complaint has been this weird issue where it keeps starting up when I turn on my TV, and I haven't had the time to figure out how to disable it yet, and the UI is unnecessarily cluttered with too much info. These are mostly nitpicks so please don't let that dissuade you from buying this console."
1883,Kaylee ,2021,5,Great image
1884,rachael,2021,5,I was so happy that I was able to purchase a PS5 and received it.
1885,Michael Mathews,2021,5,I like how fast it got delivered and the gaming experience.
1886,CJ,2021,5,It does what it does. It plays PS4 games and the 3 PS5 games that are out that anyone cares about. Very quiet console aside from a little coil whine. YMMV.
1887,Gabriel contreras,2021,5,Love it
1888,B. Long,2021,5,"Honestly haven't even tried to play actual PS5 titles. I'm really happy with the improvements that this console made with PS4 games running at a stable 60fps.It has also been quiet and doesn't seem to pump out as much heat as my old PS4 Pro. I do wish the unit was smaller, but that's the compromise right now."
1889,Kris Ranuma,2021,5,Works perfectly and faster than the old ps4. I just got lucky when the email said In stock on amazon.
1890,Alexander,2021,5,"Obviously, I'm not writing a review griping about the process of getting one. I am one of the fortunate ones that got one.With the pandemic, I've found that PS5 has been the perfect solution for all the other things that I can't do. The graphics are so much more advanced than PS4, it's not even funny. Plus it's a lot easier to use as a media hub than PS4 was since they split up games/media in the home screen.PS5 has been my best friend ever since I got it and I'm really happy I was able to grab one!"
1891,K. Carter,2021,3,Love the ps5. Arrived earlier than expected. The only problem is that the disc drive is defective. We now have to send it in and shoot another 3 weeks for it to be repaired.
1892,Eli Z.,2021,5,No problems & looks beautiful!
1893,James Krick,2021,4,"Great fast shipping, gotta live Prime! Glad to have my playstation for MSRP price instead of aftermarket value"
1894,A,2021,5,"I have not owned a console for about 7 years after switching to PC primarily for gaming, with the shortage on GPUs I decided to try and get my hands on a PS5 instead for this generation of games to be released and I'm glad I did! My favorite thing about the system is the controller and the way it gives feedback, it simply feels amazing! Only downside is the new video game prices being at $70 and not many deals unlike PC where I find deals on different apps or sites every other weekend. Overall to me this console is worth it for the exclusives yet to come and since I never owned a PS4 I'm enjoying all the sales on PS4 games on the cheap! I am saddened however that several friends can not find any in stock... hope this year is more promising with inventory so everyone can enjoy the console!"
1895,Mrs_luck3,2021,5,Just in time for my husbands bday . He loves it . Quick shipping
1896,Justin B,2021,4,"The shipping was very fast, I am very happy with the console. Thanks again,"
1897,Alvin Braziel,2021,5,Love the product the packaging box needs to be better
1898,Amazon Customer,2021,5,Awesome product
1899,orlando,2021,5,Sweet
1900,Jessica N. Pham,2021,1,Spent so much on this machine only to be let down. The console is nicely packaged and is sleek but the contents that are available for this is very lack luster. I paid hundreds of dollars for a system that has only produced a handful of new games. The games themselves cost over 60 dollars a piece as well. Sony took several years to produce this machinery and rushed it to production to compete but lacked on the sustenance.
1901,Jordan W.,2021,5,"I ended up getting this console at retail on a restock. The console worked exactly as expected and the games I were able to play, Assassin's Creed Valhalla worked amazing. The graphics were very detailed and it ran at a solid 30 fps which is good for console gaming. Overall, if you can manage to get this close to retail, or slightly above, I'd recommend it at I feel like it is a good console."
1902,Matthew Tipps,2021,5,"Came faster than expected and I love the PS5, thank you!!!!!!"
1903,Darkmane,2021,5,"Why Should you buy a PS5?If you don't have a PC, this is a must buy and delivers the best price for graphics.If you have a PC, buy a PS5 for the amazing exclusives that Sony will surely deliver, and to play the older gen titles such as GoW, HZD, Bloodbourne etc etc in 4k 60fps. Additionally the controller's dual sense technology is simply amazing and something that has HUGE potential if utilized properly.What are some things you will love about the PS5?Extremely easy to transfer your PS4 games to PS5. You can directly connect PS4 external storage and the games will work. You can also connect both PS4 and PS5 over WiFi+Ethernet cable and have all the games transferred within the hour.Download speeds are much much much better.Huge difference in the responsive of the controller. It just works better than the DS4 on PS4 games.The haptic feedback and triggers are absolutely absolutely crazy. A lot has already been said but some examples are: The controller will provide feedback so it will feel like you are in water when walking in water, when are walking on a glass surface or on a metal surface etc etc.Another example is in Astrobot, when you are ""carrying"" many bouncy balls and you could feel the bouncy balls rolling inside the controller.There is just no way to explain it in words. You have to experience it.The controller's built in mic is REALLY good and has excellent noise cancellation.PS Plus Collection is a great add on to get started and gives you around 20 ""old-gen"" games FOR FREE.What are some things you wont like about the PS5?The size.Very few ""next-gen"" games available at launch.The UI and menu while its pretty fast and responsive lacks features. Powering down, changing sound output, finding games requires several button presses and can feel like a hassle compared to PS4's ""quick menu""."
1904,Kareem Ali,2021,5,Lucky to have gotten it on launch day. Quick shipping and no issues! Love it!
1905,Phil,2021,5,Scalpers couldn't get this one. Its great!!!

1916,Ruben,2021,5,Very hard to get
1917,Yc wang,2021,5,"Great game console, enjoy the game"
1918,dabuereto,2021,5,"Everything works amazing, great console if you could avoid scalpers and get it for retail. Everything came as described although the delivery took around 1-2 weeks. The controller is honestly my favorite controller I’ve held and the game selection although small, comes out swinging."
1919,Fox Die,2021,5,"So far the system runs great playing both PS4 and PS5 games, definitely worth the purchase and a noticeable improvement over both PS4 Pro and XB1X(not to be confused with Series X, don't have one or really care about getting one anytime soon to compare) if you ever get the chance to actually get the thing.Minor complaint is with the shipping, I got it a day late and was told I'd have $10 in-store credit that I just tried to use when checking out which wasn't there but other than that I'm satisfied with the system and Amazon getting it to me within a week."
1920,Elmino Jose Pereira Figueira,2021,5,The best console ever! Very fast and the controller is amazing!
1921,Michael Nowicki,2021,4,"Loved it just came dented, the box that is."

1925,MD,2021,5,"Much more quiet than my ps4 pro, great controller, can't go wrong with PS exclusives.."
1926,Eric Bailey,2021,5,"This sucker is worth every penny! The form factor and design is beautiful in person...even though I wasn’t originally fond of it upon the initial release. The controller and its haptics are so awesome! It really pulls you more into the game. I’m astonished at the increased amount of features they put into the new controller. It feels great in the hand too. The graphics are stunning, gameplay is super smooth, and loading is minimal. The new interface and home screen are also big improvements! This is the first gaming console that has made me feel like a kid again!"
1927,Bernard paramore,2021,5,So much fun

1931,julius catalan,2021,4,"Upset that this does not have a full terabyte of storage. You would think a next generation console would be capable of at least that. Graphics are nice however, and the new controller is a nice addition."
1932,DragonBloggers,2021,5,"Love the PS5 so far, the DualSense tech in the controller, the graphics quality, the style is even fantastic.  It has a stand so it fits horizontally in a cabinet and never had any issues with it's size.  The Wi-Fi is much better and faster than the PS4 and in every way it is an improvement on the PlayStation 4 console."

1949,Thomasbusacca,2021,4,"Fun console, great remote, lightning fast, small storage.  My only problems are that the games all have a good amount of glitches and could all be tweaked and the console is huge but besides that everything is great!"
1950,Brandon spencer,2021,1,This by far the worst I’ve been thru Amazon is no help nor is Sony they tell you one thing then another lies after lies I see a lawsuit in the near future
1951,marszciano,2021,5,"True upgrade over PS4.. lighting fast, can deliver 4k 60 frames. Can even do 120 frames. Already a ton of great games due to back compat. More classics surely to come as well. If you can get one it’s well worth every cent."
1952,Johnathan,2021,5,Love it!
1953,Armando Ramirez,2021,5,"Huge upgrade from the PS4, it amazes me how much of a technological leap was made. While bigger than any console this can still fit in any area."
1954,J K,2021,5,Well worth the wait. Pure joy opening up. Comes with 1 controller.
1955,Amazon Customer,2021,5,how
1956,Bernardo J Sein,2021,5,Sony really nailed it with this console. great looking design. Habe had no problems since day one. Only problems are software related that have been fixed since launch day
1957,Brian Chum,2021,5,Absolutely stunning and beautiful next generation console. I am not shocked that this was made by Sony. I especially love the DualSense controller because I have never felt a controller like this ever. Excellent job with fantastic games!
1958,Luis,2021,5,Sorry if you haven’t gotten one
1959,MidwestMom,2021,1,It didn't work right out of the box. It has to go to PlayStation to see if they can fix it. It will probably be a month or more before we know if they'll replace it or fix it. I wish I had never bought it. My son is super upset.
1960,Amazon Customer,2021,5,LOVE IT!
1961,Glenn,2021,2,"I wanted to like it, I rally did.  Personnel taste, it is ugly.  It's an example of ""style"" over functionality.  The PS5 can not be set on it's side securely and has to stand up - limiting where you can place it.  Another serious design flaw is while it is standing up the vents are on the bottom of the PS5 and the vent holes are too small for adequate cooling of the CPU/GPU (APU since it is an AMD).  I am very disappointed in the Sony PS5, I would not recommend when you have Micro$oft X Box and Nintendo switch.  At this time (1/5/2021) due to the limited games, my family is still buying switch games, and trying to find used PS4 games to play on the PS5 - Why have a PS5 then?  Yes the graphics are great - but it has horrible cooling design flaws, personally I believe it is ugly, it can not be secured to sit on its side, and the game selection is bad.  Astrobot is a cool game... OK we have one we play."
1962,Edgar R.,2021,5,Best thing ever
1963,Adrain,2021,1,isn't waterproof. very disappointed
1964,Lou,2021,5,Definitely worth the wait. I for mine almost 2 months after release and it took some time to do but the console and the games are absolutely amazing. I'd definitely recommend to a playstation fan or to someone who hasn't had a playstation before or in a while. The playstation plus collection and ps+ is a good way to get some of the last gens best games and it's all for a playstation plus subscription. Lots of fun.
1965,ZHUOSHENG ZHANG,2021,5,"I finally get one. PS5 is so good for the people who did not own PS4 before. After buying PS+ membership, there are about 20 free PS4 games that are very good must-play games. Compatibility and performance are amazing."
1966,Peanut,2021,5,"Good design, good potential. Very entertaining to use with all the new features and faster loading times."
1967,Amazon Customer,2021,1,Just terrible
1968,Alvin,2021,5,It’s a PS5 what is there to hate? Console works well and games are high quality.
1969,Guy2,2021,5,Was lucky enough to get this on Dec. 29th. Arrived on Jan. 3. Amazingly fast shipping. Console arrived with no problem. Amazon came through.
1970,Pavel Pena Diaz,2021,5,Awesome. I was so lucky to find this one on Amazon. Love it.
1971,Leonard Qendro,2021,5,"Realized the only people leaving negative reviews are people who are pissed off they cant get the console. Absolutely amazing. Really feels next-gen. If you can manage to get your hands on one of these, you won't be disappointed."
1972,Vl87,2021,1,Absolute worst release ever no reputable company would allow this to happen. I know it doesn't matter but I will no longer be giving my hard earned money to sony.
1973,Juan Govea,2021,5,Love this console. Thanks amazon
1974,Jannella,2021,5,"Finally got one! Took some persistence, but Amazon came through and with speedy delivery. Love the design but make sure you have the space - console is huge - spaceship big. I love it so far and it feels good to reconnect with my old Socom crew on call of duty. It’s not the same but the best we have right now. Console is great and has a smooth interface."
1975,CT,2021,1,It’s crazy how people are taking advantage of the demand on this console. Why is Sony & Amazon allowing people to buy multiple consoles so people who really want it to play it can’t get it I’ve been trying for since the release to get one I’m not paying double for it
1976,A,2021,3,"Overall I think it's a good machine but the controller we got with it won't charge. Apparently a lot of people have had this issue and restarting the controller didn't work for us like it did for some. We will have to contact Sony directly.The machine is HUGE, the graphics are really nice and pleasing to look at and it is easy to use. The console itself gets really hot after a short amount of time. I do like that it has a rest mode!"
1977,Miguel A Ruiz,2021,5,Awesome Next generation console.
1978,anthony mercado,2021,5,Was what was expected.
1979,Meagan & Michael,2021,5,"This is an excellent console, I have both this and the series x and I prefer the PS, The UI is great and I love the new controller."
1980,Walt Petersen,2021,1,The delay of the PlayStation 5 in the retail market is not unusual. Demand is created before the product is available for release. The covid issue has exasperated the production delay. Some companies are overburden with levels of internal/external efficiencies and not structured to anticipate/react quickly to external market forces.
1981,Brandon ,2021,5,Yeah the whole stock availability issue is frustrating however the console delivers on it's promises and provides more. It's the real deal y'all.
1982,Tim,2021,5,"Not really much left to say about this system. It is extremely tough to find now. I got lucky with preorders back in September. The system arrived launch day in November. Here's a quick list of pros and cons:Pros:-the dual sense is the real deal. It's a huge new immersion level to gaming.-the games load rapidly on the SSD.-some games take advantage of next gen technology like ray tracing.-HDR looks amazing on this device and seamlessly works between games and UI.-Playstation store downloads are fast. Can download and install large games within an hour.-dolby digital surround sound is amazing with the right hardware.Cons:-of course the biggest is the system is impossible to find now. This is a factor of COVID supply chain issued, inability to purchase in store, and holiday rush madness.-no support for dolby atmos.-the system itself is massive. Although I personally like the design a lot.-the hard drive all things considered is too small. It will need an expansion soon.-many games now are 70 dollars."
1983,Abdoulaye Niagadou,2021,1,I'm Giving up On purchasing a Ps5 I'm sticking with my Monitor.It's Too much People are Litterally waiting days and hours just for stores to restock in-stores and Online Just for A console thats gonna Be gone for a Second Honestly im done.
1984,Youcef Taleb,2021,5,Literally defines the next generation. ☠️
1985,Tyler B,2021,5,"Instant load times, and amazing graphics!"
1986,S Lawrence,2021,5,So happy to finally get to experience the awesomeness of PS5
1987,didaliu,2021,3,There are no good games to play
1988,Dominic,2021,5,The best gift I could have bought my niece she loves it
1989,Arjan,2021,5,Nice
1990,Brandon,2021,1,ITS SIMPLE JUST SELL IT 1 PER VERIFIED HOUSEHOLD ADDRESS / ID VERIFICATION. JUST LIKE TOILET PAPER DID IN STORES YOU PEOPLE CANT DO ANYTHING RIGHT. GOODBYE AMAZON PRIME! I WILL BE BUYING THE PS5 FROM PS DIRECT THEY HAVE 1 PER HOUSEHOLD/ 1 PER ACCOUNT USER FOR SALES OPTIONS.
1991,alezah,2021,4,All parts are here so far so good
1992,Shanice,2021,5,For those who were able to get their hands on the Ps5 know this is definitely worth every penny. The dualsense controller is a game changer and I really hope they keep incorporating its potential for future games. Don't lose hope in trying to get one for those who are still struggling and DEFINITELY DO NOT give into the scalpers it's just not worth it. Patience is a virtue 🙏🏻
1993,Greg Simon,2021,4,"Very fun console. The futuristic design is very appealing. Was blown away by the graphics, next generation indeed. The haptic feedback on the controller is also amazing."
1994,Shogun assasin ,2021,1,Sony can suck it worst launch is the history of Sony
1995,Mosep,2021,1,"1) The buying experience was the worst ever.No exaggeration, I've wasted 12hrs in the last 3 months (since Sept pre-order) on constantly crashing, never ending recaptcha (which is obnoxious in normal circumstances) loops.My opinion of Sony in general is *drastically* lower after this fiasco.THIS was literally the best way to distribute they could think of? Tens of millions of people wasting their lives on crashing websites for hours at a time.Asinine.2) Same as before, there is literally NO WAY to turn off automatic updates.  Oh, there are options to change, they just have no effect.I am on cell phone Internet only and have to travel to Wi-Fi for any significant updates.So the FIRST thing I did when I got ps5, was turn off every sort of download.I set up everything and downloaded all updates, by arrangement, with Wi-Fi.Yet tonight, I connect to my hotspot and a game I had installed from disc runs a 43Gb update.Assholes.Why even have the settings to turn off automatic updates if they don't do anything?Hopefully the cell carrier will let me adjust for this month or something instead of charging the $10/2gb over plan.While I despise every. single. effing. thing. about my PS5 experience up to this point.I can only assume it's going to be the same high quality console, that keeps being impressive for a decade like ps3 & ps4.Update!  PSN service is on par with PS5 buying experience."
1996,Thuy,2021,5,Good
1997,Calvin Phan,2021,5,It was really easy to do the data transfer with my Ps4 to the Ps5. After that it was really fun to play with friends
1998,Ryan Peck,2021,5,Love it.  I've had the ps5 for a month 1/2 and no problems.  The new duel sense controller feels great.  Everything really feels next gen.  Demon Souls is the best looking console game I've ever seen.  Have my ps5 paired with a Samsung 65in KS8000
1999,Darrius ,2021,5,"I have a 1500 dollar pc and still choose to play my ps5 over it, it's such a good experience compared to the ps4"
2000,Gui,2021,5,Very nice. Love it!
2001,Chase Moore,2021,5,Worth it! Every game I played so far had been so fast and smooth with the SSD and 60 fps.
2002,Bianca Pianucci,2021,5,Finally got my ps5So happy
2003,james,2021,5,It's a Ps5. I'm Buying it for my friends and family. If I could get more I would. I am definitely going to buy again when more are available.
2004,Umar Khan,2021,2,That’s how it came damage box
2005,Kain Bailey,2021,5,Pre ordered and got it super quick. Experienced no issues what do ever!
2006,Woodard Contracting LLC,2021,5,Best console ever! Purchased thru the best retailer around Amazon!
2007,Robert L,2021,1,"Sony, you already have your loyal customer list (PS Plus). Why not offer every active subscriber a preorder? *mindblown*.  Instead, we let scalpers use bots to pick up 5, 10, or even 30 or more units to resell while loyal Sony customers get screwed over and over. GG Sony."
2008,Michelle B,2021,5,"I preordered this on September 16th with no issues what so ever. Was delivered on launch day. Even secured a second one from Target online just in case this one didn’t come through for any reason. Well Amazon came through as I mentioned so I ended up doing a special meet up at my local Target CS counter the following day (after receiving the Target console as well) and returned the second console so a random stranger I met in Target the day before (who was desperate to get one but couldn’t seem to score one no matter how hard he tried) could buy my extra one for retail... I felt I did a good deed that day and was extremely happy to see the joy on his face instead of me taking advantage and reselling the second console — even though I’m disabled and my husband has lost both of his jobs this year — one of almost 25 years and one of over 14... We definitely needed the extra money but you know what? The good karma has to be worth more...! Happy New Year all and I wish everyone the best of luck in securing a PS5 if you haven’t been able to as of yet, it’s an absolutely amazing system, especially when paired with a 65” OLED and Sonos Surround/Dolby Atmos system! Game on!"
2009,PW,2021,5,All the complainers should be used to releases being messed up..
2010,Sam simpson,2021,5,Best release in PlayStation history.
2011,Corlo,2021,1,"How come Playstation, knowing the high demand they'd definitely have for the new console, they were not prepared to fulfill the market's demand? Now there is people selling their consoles for 1000$ taking advantage of Playstation's ridiculous business strategy. I hope they get fined for market manipulation."
2012,Amazon Customer,2021,1,Play station is trash go buy a xbox nerds
2013,Aidan Shifflett,2021,1,"Sony knew full well the demand that this product would bring. This artificial scarcity is disgusting, and as customers it is time we do something so these corporations know that they can’t keep screwing over their main consumer base in favor of greedy scalpers."
2014,Jorge Chavez Jerez,2021,5,"Amazing, without a doubt the BEST console Sony has released. The resolution will blow you away and the way it plays is amazing. I was lucky enough to get one on pre-order, shoutout to Amazon!"
2015,Samar Dahal,2020,5,NEXT GEN IS HERE..Just crazy. No wonder its hard to get. Absolutely worth it..
2016,Person,2020,3,"The PS5 is a good system, not great. I own both this and the Series X and I can say that overall the SX is superior as far as interface speed, slightly faster loading times and better graphics on almost all backwards compatibility games. They don't look bad on PS5, games like AC Origins, Odyssey, Crash 4 etc. And they have a nice clarity to them. But they really lack certain textures and the color gamut is very pale in comparison. imo. Now when you're talking exclusives (from PS4) PS5 is the way to go, all the PS4 titles look amazing as they did on PS4/Pro. I think most of these games have received special ""treatment"" other 3rd party titles have not. And Sony just have the worlds best exclusives bar none.  But until actual titles made just for the PS5 are released, and not for the PS4/Pro. I can't recommend it. Because once you play these games you sit and go, well, now what? So I'd recommend holding onto your pro, since these are scarce anyway, and just wait. The same can be said for the Xbox Series X, but then again games pass just kills it, tons of free games, and if you're more of a 3rd party title person. it's just a no brainer. So the hype isn't that real about the PS5, it is a ""good"" system, but I think in the future it will be great!! Also all the problems people say they've had or are having with this, I'm not experiencing any. Super quiet, cool and not a single glitch."
2017,craftyguitar,2020,1,You wanna buy one.  Then you’re limited to not being able to haha.  What a joke.
2018,Jake Sansing,2020,5,"Loving the new PS5! The speed and graphics are out of this world! Sucks I had to pay $6,000 for it from some dude that bought a bunch to resell, but I really wanted it so oh well. Worth it if you have the extra money!"
2019,Dee,2020,1,Misbranded and misleading. Not an official PlayStation account. Scalper ripping off people.
2020,Bryce ,2020,5,"Bought the PS5 on Walmart website, got lucky, just arrived the other day to my house.  RDR2 and GTA online and story , which on ps4 usually takes awhile to load, you can bet this cuts the time in half or less. Some games like Madden seem to feel to have a delay with the new controller as of yet, but still worth the purchase.  With limited supply, I would wait for the PS5 pro, but if you can't, you won't be disappointed."
2021,Amazon Customer,2020,5,I got it 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Thanks Amazon !! 😍 surprised my boyfriend
2022,Amazon Customer,2020,4,Amazon came through when every other outlet to purchase didn’t . The ps5 is an amazing machine and design is great performance is amaizng
2023,Seraphim525,2020,5,"Great console, love the ability to play all my PS4 games and the current selection of PS5 games is fun to play, the new dual sense controller with haptic feedback is really cool to see in action and feel the feedback of your actions"
2024,Connie,2020,5,Console came fast and no issues
2025,Domingo,2020,3,When I first got this ps5 I  was excited but when playing Call of Duty Cold War it was extremely buggy not just from the stand of the game but the console was having lots of issues with keeping the wifi connected.
2026,Vincent,2020,1,"Ready to boycott Sony for this BS, and am ready to cancel my Prime membership too, yes I'm that pissed."
2027,cdunn,2020,5,"I purchased this generation of console, i have not had any major issues with it. I had an issue with the controller early on, it was sent to Sony and the replaced it quickly. No horror stories, so far so good. The games look fantastic and the media is fine. I am a little disappointed that there is no Dolby Atmos on the media content to feed back to my receiver but nothing i cannot live with. Overall I would strongly recommend the PS5."
2028,Jessica,2020,5,"Overall this product is worth the hype. Only down fall is the amount of storage is low to me, it’s a little under 700 GB but expected for the 1st model of PS5 that came out. Definitely worth the buy !"
2029,Darius,2020,5,Exquisitely engineered video game console that has buttery smooth gameplay features. Truly a marvel.
2030,Michael Shankle,2020,4,"Gigantic console, about 2 PS4s! It runs fast, my unit is very quiet. Is missing some advertised features like VRR, and the HDMI 2.1 is gimped. The new dashboard and store is flat out awful."
2031,April S.,2020,5,"Absolutely perfect console. I love it, the game play, graphics, controller, etc is awesome. for all you out there who are posting your negative responses because you decided not to pre-order while supplies last (which was advertised pre release) I'm sorry your missing out.You shouldn't be blaming Amazon and Sony for your failure to pre-order.  It's not there fault and they are doing their best to issue more consoles. You got to remember Sony isn't making any money on the console itself, it's being sold for what it costs to make.Just bare it out and eventually you will get yours. I hope they come sooner or later, happy new yr. Got mine 2020"
2032,Amazon Customer,2020,1,"This is a scam, shame on Sony."
2033,Johnebs,2020,4,"Great console in terms of power. Games look and run great. I like the design a lot but in my opinion it's too big.So far I've had no problem with the console but I really hate the shiny plastic. Mine has a very visible scratch already and I've only clean it once with a microfiber cloth.Is it worth the price? For a PlayStation fan or someone that wants to play the latest and greatest, absolutely. If you simply want a console to play modern games here and there, then get the cheaper Xbox Series S.Is it worth the scalpers price? Absolutely NOT. Do yourself a favor and wait."
2034,Hailee Nicole Austin,2020,5,I love Everything 💙
2035,dejan,2020,5,I really like the colors of the ps5 and shape Great work Sony one of the best consoles ever!
2036,Alain Peña,2020,5,Fantastic graphics and game play
2037,Ruby,2020,5,Best thing I bought on Amazon
2038,Ian,2020,5,"Fast delivery and great! Games load up so much quicker, and the graphics are way cleaner. 1000x recommend if you can get it for retail!"
2039,TreQuan Chavis,2020,4,It’s not a scam I feel bad I payed this much for it but I got it for those thinking about getting it either you can try harder next year or take a chance now they are going to come out with a black one anyways and their is 10000000000000 people who still are trying to get it if you wanna wait by all means but it’s real!!!I got mines
2040,PJ Jameson,2020,5,"Positives: Graphics are great (ray-tracing adds so much to the game), UI nice, controller is absolutely amazing. But the best part of this is the SSD and it’s insane load times. Some games, load times are a legit blink of an eye.Downsides: storage is crap. After all the needed software, your left with around 660GB for games. Which today is only 4 games or so, give it take. Yeah you could use an external SSD/HD but then you lose the best part of this system - it’s amazing load times. Sony needs to open it up to allow internal storage upgrades. Other than that, and this next one should have no real barring on you getting one, but the actual PS5 is Huge and Ugly."
2041,Alex Cormier,2020,5,"I was very lucky to buy this consol  on launch day and U am very happy with it. It both runs and downloads games very fast and the haptic controller feels very well made. It's very cool to feel the gun trigger on spring on the triggers. Overall, very well made."
2042,Amy weir,2020,5,"I am enjoying it, but man are they hard to get a hold of. Thankfully I got it."
2043,Rosa Saldana,2020,1,Since October I have been trying to buy one for my grandson with no luck. I am not paying all that money
2044,David 3,2020,5,I’d like the PS5 it’s great
2045,Bola,2020,5,The PlayStation 5 is everything a gamer can dream of.  With that said the Xbox series X does garner better components than it's counter part.  However the PS5 exclusives really put the PS5 ahead of the Xbox for me!  Happy gaming y'all!
2046,Jessie Acuna,2020,5,"I bought this for my husband and he loves it. He likes that there is a mini speaker and microphone in the controller, as well as a touchpad. The system seems to run smoothly and the fact that it is backwards compatible is a plus."
2047,Damian Doty,2020,5,"It’s exactly what I expected. Sony has been my go-to for gaming since the original PlayStation and though I have no specific love for their platform, nor dislike for others, I find that it suits my needs and delivers the games I care about most. It is indeed the next generation of consoles, and it proves it right out of the box.I would say that unless you need Demon’s Souls in your life right now, there’s no reason not to wait, and no reason to feel rushed. There is a lack of content that’s meant for the PS5 (as in, really, just a couple games) and nothing very compelling coming early 2021."
2048,Sumit Purkayastha,2020,1,"Shame on Sony. Such a famous tech company and they had 7 years to prepare for the unleashing of PS5 and they produced such a small number of consoles that we are trying for months and waking up at 5 in the morning, refreshing the pages over and over again. Still we can't get one. Even I could get into the Target drop and added to cart and everything, still at the end it failed because of selling out. I mean, what a joke. Such a big company and they knew that the demand would be high, why didn't they produce enough number of ps5s, or they wanted to make the scalpers profitable? Some people are getting 2-3 or even more - disc, digital both and we keep refreshing the pages and waiting to see any notification and still can't get one even after getting into the order page. Worst launch of all time!!"
2049,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Everybody is so salty cause they couldn’t get one on launch day.  So privileged.....  Ever think of pre ordering?  Don’t hate the scalpers, supply and demand.This thing is worth every penny !!! Graphics are worth the price of admission."
2050,David John,2020,5,Awesome
2051,Bradley Gay,2020,5,It’s a PS5 lol enough said
2052,Reynaldo S.,2020,1,So disappointed! I mean I t really breaks my heart watching my son be so excited just by the thought that he might finally have a ps5 and there I am waiting and waiting and the all of the sudden there gone in a heartbeat! Now I have to watch him crying I mean It’s crazy!
2053,Carlos Jimenez,2020,5,Yea that's right I got one.
2054,Steven,2020,5,"Lo mejor, increíble"
2055,Steve,2020,5,"I was lucky enough to get this product when it launched, the system itself is fantastic. Constantly produces good FPS as well as much better load times than the Playstation 4."
2056,David Vasquez,2020,5,It’s perfect! I received a notification as I was trying to get in online at another retailer! Delivered within 5 days and started playing immediately! What a gorgeous system and a great way to end this terrible year!! Thanks Amazon!
2057,Diego Castillo,2020,5,Awesome!
2058,Desiree,2020,5,"The best! Shipping was fast! Packing was good, but it was left on my porch driver didn’t knock or ring door bell! I’m thinking I saw the driver pull up!"
2059,albin salguero,2020,1,You suck mf
2060,Kevin Stepheny ,2020,5,Nice will buy again
2061,Joshua clee,2020,1,"People you are better off buying a computer that runs better graphics, fps , and pc exclusive games then waiting months for a console locked at certain things"
2062,Quan,2020,5,Amazing fast shipping and great console
2063,EG,2020,5,Been playing PS5 and PS4 games and so far impressed with the FPS and next gen graphics.  PS4 games play at smooth 60FPS.
2064,RC,2020,1,"Scalped product, don’t buy."
2065,LPoole,2020,5,Love my system!
2066,Ashante,2020,1,Way too overpriced
2067,GT,2020,1,Rip Off
2068,Laura E.T.,2020,1,"Wow, that mark up."
2069,Sunny,2020,1,Do not buy for this price. Buy a warranted device from Amazon or a store. You want to make sure your device has a warranty since it is a new release
2070,rigoberto  revilla,2020,1,Mejor me espero en unos dias ya estara en todas partes por menos precio
2071,T. Caldwell,2020,5,Not much more to say. Next gen is here. Performs flawlessly. Fast load times. Ray tracing on Spider-Man miles morales was super sweet. I like the UI but not the ads that run through the homepage when powering on.
2072,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"People are angrily reviewing the PS5 because it's not in stock, and haven't been able to buy one. How do they not realize that covid has dramatically effected production of the consoles? Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendos production'sare all being effected by covid.  Stop acting like the gaming industry owes you something."
2073,Nam N. Nguyen,2020,5,Hard to get but worth it
2074,JC,2020,5,"Even coming from an Xbox One X (not Series X) it's still a clear graphical upgrade. Ray Tracing in Spider-man, Astro's Playroom and Sackboy is spectacular."
2075,Franklin Urdiales,2020,2,Costs to much
2076,Sameer,2020,5,Wonderful
2077,Luis,2020,5,"Wow super hyped with new console, been playing for couple of days and works as it should. Wayyyy faster than PS4"
2078,J K,2020,5,"Bought 4 of these and was able to flip 3 of them for 1300 and kept the last one for myself! Console is great, Sony outdid themselves and made me a ton of money at the same time! In december 24th i sold my last disc edition to a single mother who spent her last 1.2k with me in order to buy her son the console. It made me feel so good that I was able to make her son’s christmas. Felt like Santa Claus."
2079,Socratez,2020,1,I have spent countless hours and days trying to buy 1 online for my home just to enjoy playing and have failed at every chance I’ve tried. It is extremely frustrating that scalpers can be allowed to use specific software to hog up these units for outrageous profits! There should be a limit put on these units to stop this ridiculous scheme. Yes I also blame Sony for contributing to this mess. They knew very well the demand would be high for these units. I am “not” going to pay 3x the amount for a unit and will just wait. I do not think it’s right to make people search + 100 hours and over a month just to try a buy a PS5 Unit! I’m sorry but it’s beyond ridiculous...
2080,mcottage,2020,5,The item looks nice and works great.
2081,Antonio Reyes,2020,1,I been a Sony customer for ever since ps1 but not anymore Sony does want my money
2082,Henry Duong,2020,5,Thank you for the fast shipping amazon!!!! My kid loves it.
2083,Prince Malcolm,2020,5,What’s there to say?! Do not believe the hype with the overheating systems and or the glitches coming from the folk that are not technologically savvy or the casual gamer. The hype for the system was a little bit overkill but it’s well worth the $500. Delivery was up exceptional. Don’t kill yourself Or try to rob anyone for this. Wait for it next year when a plethora of new games were arrive to the system.
2084,Amazon Customer,2020,1,Blah bleh naw meh
2085,Her,2020,5,Perfection! Plus you get that 2-day fast delivery with Amazon Prime!
2086,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Came in within 2 days after my order was placed and was in perfect condition my first and probably only Console I’ve ever purchased online and glad I did cause it’s almost never in stock... guess I just got lucky
2087,Erik Bannister,2020,5,"Awesome product. I am neither a Xbox or a PS fanboy, but the PS5 feels new and refreshing. Only downside is theirs not a lot of PS5 designed games, so naturally the experience is fairly limited right now."
2088,H12,2020,5,"I love the PS5, simply due to taking all the downsides of the PS4 Pro and correcting them.  The unit runs nearly silently (my PS4 Pro sounded like a jet engine).  The load times are great, keeping you in the game instead of waiting.  The new UI takes a minute to get used to, but it is also a huge upgrade and again makes it quicker and easier to get around."
2089,floyd harrison,2020,1,Disgrace!
2090,Andres Builes,2020,1,Garbage!
2091,William F.,2020,5,"Playstation 5 is an incredible system with a lightning fast solid state drive and hardware ray tracing, compared to the the Xbox Series X specifications, on paper they are both nearly identical in hardware with the xbox narrowly pulling ahead in terms of 4k performance, how they actually perform comparatively in the real world will depend on developers properly optimizing their games for each console. current retail price is US$499 for Disc version, and US$399 for the digital only version. do not buy from scalpers, you can play a few ps4 versions of ps5 releases on ps4/pro then upgrade the game to the ps5 version for free when you migrate to the ps5"
2092,Raul,2020,1,Way to much not paying a 1000 dollars for a ps 5
2093,Prissy88,2020,1,"Sony, you suck."
2094,Roy A. Teel Jr.,2020,2,"Okay, I, like so many who have written on this site, tried desperately to get a PS5 on pre-order in September but it didn’t happen. I was on Amazon, Sony, and the list goes on but the bots got them and anyone who has been on eBay knows what I’m talking about. I did however, put in an order for a PS5 through an “Available from these sellers” link on Amazon on November 12th but when I got to the links I was shocked at the pricing, the sellers were on eBay, StockX all over the place and prices were out of this world. Disc units were going for up to $2000 USD, and digital the same. I ended up hooked up with a seller however, through Amazon, even after Amazon killed the link. You can still buy ALL of the accessories for the PS5 on Amazon from, “Available from these sellers” from the three D headphones to remotes cameras etc. and they are ALL brokers but not PS5’s. So, when I learned that the units are hopelessly out of stock and most likely won’t be in stock until next May or June, I bit the bullet and bought an all-digital unit for $999.First impressions, if Sony was looking to release a twenty-first century looking unit, they missed the mark by sixty-five years. If this unit were released at Disney Land in tomorrow land in 1955 it would have worked but in 2020 NOPE. My wife looked at it when I put it on the TV stand on its side as that’s how I use my units and she said, “It looks smushed, did someone sit on it or did it melt?” I could not help myself I just started laughing because the unit itself is UGLY.Size and shell construction, the unit weighs fourteen pounds, and is double the size of the PS4 it is incredibly quiet when running but it’s massive and takes up a lot of space. The shell looks terrible the white shell is very, very thin plastic if you drop this you WILL break it, the inner black is shiny but Sony would have been better off going all black. I understand they need to cool the components but aesthetically the unit is ugly.On the front of the unit there is a standard USB 2.0 and a high-speed USB 3.0. On the back you have power, the HDMI out for video and audio to the TV and ethernet hub (I don’t know why Sony did this everything is wireless these days) then two USB 2.0 high speed hubs there is NO optical input/output on the PS5 for headphones and PS5 does NOT support Bluetooth audio yet again.The unit is supposed to come with an internal one TB SSD drive that’s not what you get, its actually about 690 GHZ and if you download your PS4 games to it you will eat up the drive in a flash, no pun intended. So, you need an external drive, however, here is where the money starts adding up. The unit itself is cheap but all you get is the system and one controller and if you’re a gamer like me, you need more than one controller and a lot more stuff, and that runs up the tab so you better have a lot of cash to invest in this system.Sony says you can use your HDD from your PS4 on the PS5 to play your PS4 games NOT SO, the PS5 does NOT read the HDD so forget about it I tried every work around I could (I was on YouTube for hours looking and nothing) the system would not recognize any of my HDD drives. So, I invested in a Samsung 1 TB SSD drive $200 bucks you’re going to need this and you’re going to need an even bigger drive. I have looked at other SSD drives and for a five TB SSD it is about $600 so get ready to put out a lot more cash for this system. Given the sheer size of games coming to the console in the coming months and years one TB might hold only one or two games.Speed: Load speeds are okay, when I load GTA Online with my high-speed internet it takes about forty seconds. Now that is fast when you consider on PS4 it takes about a minute to a minute and a half or longer as Rockstar advertises in game stuff during the load. I’m sure that Rockstar and Take Two Interactive will find a way to slow the process when they release the new GTA Online later next year. In game frame rate changes, fast and clean however, the system moves a little too fast for a lot of PS4 games like Hitman, Assassins Creed Call of Duty and the list goes one so the images can get blurry. I thought it was my vision at first but it’s not, the PS5 moves so fast the games can’t load as fast as the processor in the PS5 can bus the data.Picture: I went all out before buying the PS5 and invested in a brand new 2020 75” Samsung QLED 800 Smart Ultra 8K TV. The TV converts anything to HD and to 4K and it has a game mode setting on it to improve the look of games so I really see little difference between my games from PS4 to PS5. However, if you don’t have at least a 4K TV you’re wasting your money on this system, the PS5 is designed for 4K and can be upgraded (at an extra cost) to 8K which I did by purchasing high speed 8K HDMI cables $90. So, beware if you’re going to go in on this system you better be prepared to put out at least another one to two thousand dollars if you go low end with the TV and accessories, if you go high end like I did, well, let’s just say I’m in now about $5K. However, while the in-game picture and graphics are GREAT if you want to watch a movie or video the quality of the images goes down hill fast. The system darkens the video and I have done every possible fix I can on the PS5 and nothing works. However, if I go over to my PS4 the picture is GREAT so it definitely has something to do with the PS5 video cards but I have no idea what it is I hope Sony will release a patch for this but as of now I can’t stream movies or TV shows on PS5, at and at least not enjoy them.Audio: Sony has been touting their custom 3D audio and they have released a new pair of headphones just for this new audio. A word of warning, this audio ONLY works with select games, as of right now the only game I have that it works with is Assassins Creed Valhalla, if you use the 3D audio settings for other games the sound sucks plain and simple. The Sony headphones are going to set you back another $100 so be prepared for that. All in all, on the audio I’m not impressed at ALL either on my TV or my headphones. I use regular settings on my phones and the sounds is as good as on my PS4 so to me the 3D build is hype perhaps some reading this can tell me if they have found a way to use the 3D audio successfully.Overall impression of the PS5? Not impressed, for a next gen console and all the hype that Sony has put out on this it really is no big deal. In the end when the units are plentiful and everyone can get their hands on one Sony is going to make bank not on the systems but the accessories, I know there are bugs still to work out but a month and a half in I wish I would have saved my money and waited until spring."
2095,Jay,2020,5,Only bought it to play PlayStation exclusives. Nothing fancy. $500 + tax for 4K games.
2096,Kiabe,2020,1,Scalper no scalping
2097,Keith Streeter,2020,1,DO NOT BUY OVER RETAIL. ITS A SCAM!
2098,ForgottenKing,2020,5,10/10 got my Ps5 the day after release with one say shipping. Love it !
2099,Matt stark,2020,5,best console ever
2100,Kyle P. Bayuk,2020,1,"I have every Nintendo and every Playstation and have them all hooked up and ready to play anytime I want.  The PS5 is definitely not worth the hype.  The graphics and speed are only incrementally better than the PS4 and on top of that the UI is laggy and is about the same speed as well. The build quality is for crap as well.  I don’t know if it’s me, but the system still gets very hot and is as loud as the PS4 was, if not more.  I don’t know what they were talking about with the haptic feedback being better.  I did not notice any difference between the PS4 and this.  Since I have both systems hooked up I turned both on and was switching back and forth and did not notice and discernable difference on any of the items I just went into.  So, I’m not sure what Sony was talking about when they said it was a huge improvement.  They definitely hyped this system up way too much and it does not live up to it.  This is the biggest disappointment since I got Gran Turismo Sport.  When I got that I put it in the system once and realized what it was.  So, I took it out and put it up on the shelf and there it has sat since the game has come out.  I will more than likely being doing the same thing with this thing.  If you must have it, I would wait a couple years for them to at least fix all the technical issues.  But, by that time the PS5 Pro will be out and then you would have to wait a couple more years for the bugs to be worked out on that as well and then by that time it would be better to just wait until the PS6 comes out.  Honestly this is not a good generation for gaming consoles as whole, especially the PS5.  So, if I were you I would wait until the PS6.  Hopefully they get their act together by then, otherwise I feel as if game consoles won’t last.  I will say it again, this is the biggest let down since Gran Turismo Sport."
2101,Chaim,2020,5,"I love playing on my PlayStation 5. I always play with my little brothers, and beat them in every game. The controllers are very ergonomic and comfortable. The console itself however, could definitely use some work and cooling. It does get pretty hot at times to be honest. All In all, the gameplay was at least a 9 out of 10.Sony did a fantastic job and I can't wait to play NBA 2K on my new ps5"
2102,tom rancour,2020,5,Love the product bought all 31 ps5 best buy had on release day was able to sell all of them in 2 days turned a killer profit wish Amazon had some more available kudos to Sony incredible company

2105,AVSRoyal,2020,1,Sony failed it's customers. You e had years to roll out a system that could beat bots at retailers. You don't care as long as the checks clear. Xbox here I come.
2106,Jeff A. Elder,2020,5,The PS5 is a console that has lots of speed and intelligence that makes gaming very enjoyable. The fast start up and smooth gameplay puts gaming laptops to shame finally. A must have console

2108,Lady Red,2020,1,"After buying every console sony ever made i can say im about to switch teams. This is disgusting how they treat their fans, letting scalpers buy up everything then not restocking. Why sell on walmart.com when you KNOW full well they have ZERO experience handling online sales of such a item. Ofcourse scalpers got em all with one bot set up aimed at chinas super center aka walmart! You obviously knew it was gonna sell out so why even launch it when you had no where near the numbers already made that you should of before launching. Shame on you sony!!! After years of exceptional customer service and care you flatlined in one swoop."

2111,KC,2020,5,"Was pretty tough to get, but luckily I saw it in stock in the middle of the night and was able to get this amazing console. The technology in the controller, and the high quality that this console can push out made my playing experience wonderful. PS5 is better than XBOX all day."
2112,Diego Perez,2020,5,It’s lit.

2114,Joe,2020,5,Everything was perfect. On time. VERY NICE guy. PS5 was sealed and he even sent a gift receipt. So ty!
2115,Anitha Kamaraj,2020,4,Great console of the latest generation. Tough to get one but I am lucky to get one. Runs smooth and loads better. Games are not made to take full power of the console yet. Give it a year then you will see obvious result.
2116,Nicholas Chan,2020,5,"The family loves it so much! Despite everyone saying it's a new product and it'll have problems, mine has not had any problems whatsoever. Sony always creates quality products nonetheless."
2117,Tony,2020,1,"Coming from Law Enforcement, I feel it should be a crime to buy and sell for double or triple the price. I'd be happy to put these scum bags in jail!"
2118,Abel Solorzano,2020,1,simple as that. wait them out..  There will be and over stock right after the holidays.  Just wait. don't buy into this non sense.

2123,K. T. Smith,2020,5,This console is amazing well worth the wait and awesome games ignore the haters they’re ether jealous sheep that wish they can have one or Xbox fanboys lol
2124,Christopher Ahl,2020,1,Wow... what a scam. Worst console release ever!!!
2125,RICK,2020,5,The GOAT of gaming consoles and it’s only just begun. Load times... what’s load times? Incredible.. they’ve finally done it. Controllers are OUTSTANDING. Well done Sony .. very well done.
2126,Garrett Clark,2020,5,"Complaining about Sony not being able to supply the ps5? Yeah, people suck and take advantage. Seriously though, we went/are going through a pandemic and y'all think it's crazy you cant get your hands on one. keep crying, TBH, save your $500, invest it and be ready for the late 2020's. If history repeats itself it's not looking good."
2127,Will garcia,2020,5,It is awesome all of you are paying way too much for it and that is why you are salty so you are talking and you didn’t even buy it from a trustworthy buyer think before you buy
2128,Mr. Right,2020,5,"Amazing system with blazing fast processing and breathtaking graphics.  Backward compatibility is a huge bonus and ray tracing and 8k support deliver a futureproof system.  The show stealer is the controller though, like VR it's a hard thing to truly appreciate until you've tried it but the new capabilities of the haptic systems are incredible. It sucks that it will take so long for many to get one with all these dang scalpers chewing up inventory but the wait for a msrp system will be totally worth it."
2129,Steve Garcia,2020,5,Spiderman ran above 60fps while looking incredible
2130,AK-Adam,2020,1,This is reduclious impossible to get one online ecerytime I try all the web sites just crash wtf... Sony should be ashamed.
2131,Robert m.,2020,1,"Amen!!!!It’s crazy I have three boys 10,12 and 14I wanted to get them ps5 for ChristmasIt’s been a difficult year for all of us with me having less hours at work cutting back the spending and the boys not seeing they’re friends because of not attending school all I want is to make them happy and get them one for ChristmasCome on Sony it’s a year with a pandemicStop playing games!!!!!"
2132,Austin G,2020,5,Totally exceeded my expectations! Awesome machine and at the hight of a game the console runs so smooth and quiet. PS4 games run way smoother and PS5 games will blow you away and so so quite compared to my PS4 Pro it barley buzzes the disk rpm is louder than the system that's how quite it is
2133,Fernando,2020,5,I like everything about the ps5 it’s great.
2134,kristina,2020,5,Licky I got one! Thank You.Amazon.for making it easy for me to purchase! I tried everywhere else and all I got were errors at checkout or out of stock!
2135,Laura K. Stritt,2020,5,Xbox garbage ps5 amazing console war summarized :)
2136,Mike,2020,5,Look to have found one amidst the chaos! No problems at all with the delivery either 5 stars!
2137,BryBoi,2020,4,"It's taking some time for compatible software and hardware to become available, so this is from playing Assassin's Creed Valhalla and some PS4 games on it. First major compliant is that it keeps shutting off when I put it in rest mode. This causes the console to search for errors and then lecture you about turning it off properly. It also prevents itself from letting the controller turn it back on when this happens, you have get up off the couch, walk all the way over there, then push the button on console itself. It's getting really annoying. Hope there's an update to fix that soon. Load times are WAY down, I don't even have time to check facebook on my phone during load screens any more. The controller doesn't feel as large as it looks, which is nice. Takes a while to charge, but can be played while charging if your cord is long enough. And finally, it's big. Like, you'll probably need to declutter your TV area and get rid of stuff that don't spark joy, big. But it works well, glad I got it."
2138,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Absolutely love the ps5 it’s amazing
2139,Josh Terrill,2020,5,"incredible in every way possible, feel bad for those who can’t cop"
2140,santosh,2020,5,One of the finest gaming device
2141,Jose Corrales,2020,5,It's a ps5 so it's great. Only complaint is controller battery life isn't that great.
2142,Mr. Soto,2020,1,"Wath i get insulting, its that many of us receive the invitation of Sony direct to purchased the PS5 console directly from Sony, for being a PS Plus menber. After half hour on que, waiting to complete the purchased. The system does not let me complete the purchase in the shopping cart. The island of Puerto Rico U.S. territory were y live, was excluded. Try to put my zip code and the system does not let me go through. Discriminating? Its a shame, after many years the island has being a consumer and supporter of the Sony brand overall, not only PS products. They came and go to the island to import and do business as they like.  As many companies  and brands has done in the past. There only interests are there's interests, no the interests and respect of the consumers in the island and around the world. Thats is the second class or even third class US citizenship we have here in the island. Also for being a Prime menber to this they, I did not receive the courtesy of any alert or notification that the product was available because its in my notify me list. This is the problem of this huge monster's companies, they forget ho feeds them to get to that zise. Any resemblance to a politician or a political party it's pure coincidence."
2143,richard lewis,2020,1,I Agree with all one star comments
2144,Omar L.,2020,1,😂
2145,Anthony Fuchs,2020,5,"Phenomenal console, the exclusives are amazing. Even better, last gen games perform so much better it's worth the buy."
2146,RLC,2020,5,Beautiful machine. Perfect right out of the box. Glad I was finally able to get my hands on one!Best next gen console on the market.
2147,Maverick ,2020,5,What to say? It is AWESOME! Truly next level gaming at it's finest by the best in the business. Quality is crisp! Make sure you have a viable 4K TV to play this on and not some cheap low quality trash like ONN.
2148,nguyen duy lam,2020,5,Perfect Christmas gift for my son. He played all day
2149,JustaRandomGuy,2020,5,"This is definitely the most toughest purchase in game/console history.  I am pretty sure PS5 will get more stocks in the future. Anyway, I am so lucky that i was able to buy my PS5 at retail price.  This console is REALLY REALLY awesome.  Excellent graphic on my 4K TV and amazing performance that the console can deliver by its powerful GPU.  The PS5 itself is already a piece of art. This PS5 feels like the future of console gaming!  I love it!!  I cant wait to play Cyberpunk 2077."
2150,Big Dawgs Fam,2020,5,"I never purchased the PS4, I didn’t have much time to play or just never had the urge buy it, but we do have the Nintendo Switch for the kids. I would have to say it is night and day as I expected with the graphics wish and load times. We have only played Miles Morales and the graphics are awesome, the dual sense controller are accurate and feel really good in hand.I know the resellers market is ridiculous, but prices are going down, I paid $150 premium for not waiting, better than paying double the retail, I am very happy with the purchase, the system is impressive, definitely recommended!"
2151,Cassandra Davenport,2020,5,"Love my PS5! The graphics are amazing, and the controller is so comfortable to hold. The only issue I have is the white stains easily from usage."
2152,Manny leon,2020,5,Was able to purchase on release day. Got here 2 days later been enjoying my ps5 ever since so much fast and quieter than my ps4
2153,Alfonso,2020,5,Good
2154,Kindle Customer,2020,1,"If I could, I would give -5 stars... this person is over pricing it and... admit it... they system is not even perfected. Its having many issues. Don't get me wrong I love Sony but this system was not ready to be relesed."
2155,Abdulrahman,2020,5,The best console ever!!
2156,Denys Hluskyi,2020,5,"Everything running smoothly, but my wife became unhappy and started to complain that I'm spending a lot of time with my precious.Can recommend for non-married persons."
2157,Heri,2020,5,Honestly the best part about this is the controller. Very interactive and has good feedback. The console specs are good but is lacking a larger selection of next gen games. Obviously that will be remedied with time
2158,Kindle Customer,2020,4,"It's the new PS5, not a whole lot i can say that hasn't been covered dozens of times in reveiws. The design is nice, sort of grows on you. The quality of the games I have played so far are rather nice and comparable to a decent mid ranged gaming pc. I wouldn't call it a PC Killer, but one heck of an upgrade for couch gaming!"
2159,Michael J Egan,2020,5,Works great so far the system is 100% upgrade from the PS4 Pro in every way the controller is a 300% upgrade from the cheap piece of junk controller that came with my PS4 Pro and regular PS4 as for games you have Spiderman as a triple A title and then a lot of average games Demon Souls is a beautiful looking remaster of the old PS3 Demon Souls game but its just that THE SAME GAME with better graphics and with a $70 pricetag a complete ripoff!
2160,crystal,2020,5,"My son received this for excellent grades, to say the least since Winter Break started he has been on it nonstop. He loves it, after upgrading from a PS3. The graphics are “out of this world”. He has indicated that some download issues have occurred, but were resolved very quickly. I am pleased/grateful that I was able to purchase this from Amazon, as ALL other outlets were sold out from the beginning."
2161,Eric,2020,1,I've been waiting for the ps5 for about a year I've been saving to buy it. Well I will have to keep waiting to see what happens and in no way am I going to buy a ps5 at an inflated price.
2162,David Silva Jr,2020,5,Very thankful for the Quick checkout and quick delivery of this amazing console 😁 Worked like new
2163,Anthony,2020,5,"Its really amazing. Easy set up, software is different from ps4. I love the USB ports. It runs fast, looks nice. Only downfall it is as big as the OG Xbox. We have had no issues. The controller charging is super fast, they work really great. Downloading games is fast. Just the overall speed on it, is incredible."
2164,Brandon,2020,2,"Well AMAZON & SONY, guess what? Now, at least for myself, since you both clearly show the lack you both are obviously drinched to the bone in of how little you care or appreciate the consumers that keep your companies from being another failed business, all out of greed for the accessive gains you wrench out of the honest, sincere, and consumer oriented businesses by undercutting them then stealing there customers till they go bankrupt, and you cant even try, not even a little, and that you can prove from time after time encountering the same issues, and use the same remedies and lies to sweet talk people. Enough is enough, youve proven you cannot commit to making the experience better for the customer, and i mean better as in helping out of wanting make the service a more possitive in more than just how it looks to the public, but in a selfess, down to earth, person that already has to deal with everyday life, not in a suite in a skyscraper or Mansion atop the hills. I waited long enough for next gen and am more than willing to wait far much longer if it means you wont get my business and hopefully many more down the road of your avoidance to have true PR and sloppy methods of business that you already KNOW FROM PAST OCCURRENCES when producing, supplying, and shipping a product you know very well without a doubt is going to be record setting or at least close. I understand the supply demand game and making the demand more by doing these very things because it helps boost short term sales, but in doing so you are instilling a bit of distrust and feeding that little ol voice in peoples head that sais stop, avoid this situation and go elsewhere because its gonna end negatively. So ill gladly take that step and ill save your money, and go spend it on something that will actually give good memories ill be able to enjoy later in life when im reminiscing about how the downfall of such large companies began to fall apart at the seems all because they felt they could go on without considering those paying there bills. Good luck both of you. You might do fine for awhile but you know what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you."
2165,Giovanni,2020,5,People just need to wait! Everyone is complaining about resell prices and lack of consoles .. just wait ! More consoles will be out next year and probably less glitchy
2166,Dr A,2020,5,This is the best next-gen gaming system on the market right now. I was lucky enough to get one of these with prime shipping before the new year. I love the speed of the menu and the look of the new controller. Blown away by the graphics and gameplay and currently playing NBA 2k21 and Spiderman but can't wait to see the new games that come out for the PS5 in 2021. The controler took me a bit to get used to since I came from Xbox but the learning curve is small and I'm really happy I decided to purchase a new gaming system and not a PC.
2167,Luciano,2020,5,"Works really well, great console."
2168,Brandon Archer,2020,5,Amazing console and happy to say that I've now owned 3 :)
2169,Victoria B,2020,5,I feel extremely lucky to have been able to purchase this console for my brother-in-law. Its super hard to grab one right now. He has been in heaven since receiving it. He says the graphics and gameplay are superb.
2170,Steve Givens,2020,5,The PS5 is an excellent upgrade from the ps4.
2171,Hayden Kowalchuk,2020,5,Amazing game console!Sony really outdid themselves for the new generation.Also a huge bonus that it still plays all of the now old ps4 games.Definitely a Christmas showstopper!
2172,Sebastian Zamudio,2020,5,"This is without a doubt, the best console ever made to date. Excellent performance and a top-notch new controller."
2173,Darren stokes,2020,5,It’s amazing thank you Amazon
2174,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Great communication with the seller. Did have warranty. Perfectly new. Received it in less than two days.
2175,Andrew,2020,5,Just in time for Christmas🎅🏿
2176,Grady P,2020,5,It’s been great so far. No major crashes or issues.
2177,Ashton Redd,2020,5,absolutely what you expected and more
2178,Duncan King,2020,5,Really enjoy the console
2179,George ,2020,3,"Happy I was able to get the PS5. It was difficult getting it, but glad I did. Im only giving it a 3 because It was nearly impossible getting it.PS5 is awesome though! Played Miles Morales for a few hours."
2180,Kendall Gardner,2020,5,Great system. no complaints.
2181,Joshua Prendergast,2020,5,Great product.  Playstation delivers once again.  Must buy for everyone.
2182,Ahmed Yousaf,2020,5,"Working great , size is bigger than any console on market ,set up is easy , making strange noises some time , but every thing works great."
2183,RSAC,2020,5,I was one of the lucky enough to have thus preordered since September. As of now my ps5 works fine without any major issues. Sometimes the game can crash but is not too often. Stability patches release over time. Also dont pay scalpers and the console is Huge
2184,Chosen1,2020,5,"I love it ! This is my first Sony purchase since the PS1 . I must say I’m happy to be back , the load time is extremely fast , the controller is amazing & im enjoying all of these exclusive games such as last of us , uncharted , God Of War .You guys won’t regret this purchase , keep trying and stay consistent you will get a PS5 ."
2185,Mayra,2020,5,Awesome love it
2186,Obi-Wan Kenobi,2020,5,It's an amazing system if you can get it. Very fast and well worth the price compared to a PC with ray tracing.
2187,Charly,2020,5,I love it the best console
2188,Irtiza Choudhry,2020,5,CANT GO WRONG WITH SONY
2189,Jared,2020,5,"The console works great, delivery was quick. The UI takes getting used to, but load times and speed are incredibly quicker than the PS4. Whenever they’re back in stock, I’d say grab one."
2190,Rewat,2020,5,"Runs super smooth on the Sony 900H, getting high FPS on HDMI 2.1. Worth the wait, thank you Amazon! :)"
2191,Christian,2020,5,Glorious ❤️
2192,Mar,2020,5,Thankkkks amazon it was handled with care!! Works well controller feels very good than the ps4!!But the controller seems to get dirty easily because of it being white.
2193,zl,2020,5,greatest console ever.
2194,Michael,2020,4,The hype is real. I understand why there is so many people going for this and why it is so popular now. I was luckily able to get one of them and I am so excited to have it in my arsenal. The sleek aesthetic and clean design make it fit my setup well and the system is very fast and the UI is great. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is because it needs more games to play! :))
2195,Fonzin,2020,5,"What can I say it’s a game console from the gods. It’s a game console worthy of Chuck Norris using it. In fact it’s a game console that only Chuck Norris could’ve got his hands on. That was until amazon came though with the pre order!Not only has this game console made me the most popular person in my neighborhood, literally ladies have been throwing their bra and panties at me ever since I’ve purchased this. I am now on the road to have about nine baby mamas (from all the neighborhood kids throwing their moms at me so they can play Spider-Man on my PS5)  and will soon have to sell the PS5 to pay for all their child support.So good luck getting it since I know they are sold Out! However be weary of the consequences of having such a great power in your hands.Just as Spiderman said in the game I’m playing on this PS5: with great power comes great responsibility.So be sure to wrap it up when tapping all the single moms that are throwing themselves at you so you can let their kids use your console !"
2196,Salar Qureshi,2020,5,Love it thank you
2197,Drew,2020,5,"This was not easy to secure, pure luck on 11th 3am drop. Def worth the trouble tho this baby plays real nice with my lg cx. I love how much faster it is although i guess you’d get that from up-to-date specs lol. Actually plays cyberpunk now and soon even better with free nextgen update in 2021! The UI will take some getting used as it’s different then last gen but everything is really good in regards to graphics and new dualsense  controller. Next gens here!"
2198,David,2020,5,"Got mine! It sucks for all you crybabies sitting there refreshing day n night who can’t get it, its time too grow up and be patient little children its just a game not system their is more to life 🤣🤣🤣"
2199,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Amazing console! Loving every bit of it!
2200,nobody,2020,1,Amazon should not allow this knowing that this is way over priced and people dont bother
2201,Raphael,2020,5,I'm lucky to get one. Nothing to not like about it. Amazing console.
2202,Stephan,2020,1,"Dont encourage this, wait for the restock or go somewhere else!"
2203,bratton caldwell,2020,1,Wtf really
2204,Chasse M Leger,2020,1,Don’t do it
2205,Loussine,2020,5,It’s feel very good to get one at retail price.It is the best gaming consoles ever!
2206,Jacinto Rodriguez Montoya,2020,1,Not cool
2207,Callie German,2020,5,My husband was able to get one of these after trying all day with other stores. I am willing to sell it to the highest bidder.
2208,Michael Borick,2020,1,Piracy
2209,Elisa vildosola,2020,5,Muy rápida la Entrega y productos totalmente nuevo y sellado.
2210,Cocokid,2020,5,...b/c this will leave you in the DUST.
2211,Dwight Danie,2020,5,"Come on Sony, you need to step up production so that my friends can play with me."
2212,boyblunder,2020,5,!Lucky to have secured an order on launch day at retail price and get it delivered. Been swinging around quite smoothly over the big apple.
2213,Amazon Customer,2020,1,Don't buy at this price!
2214,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Despite some minor issues, I've really enjoyed my PS5 so far. It's fast, quiet, and all the games I've played on it (especially Spiderman: Miles Morales) look phenomenal."
2215,David e,2020,5,"Kinda crazy to see all these 1 star “reviews” of people upset they couldn’t get one. Since I ACTUALLY purchased one I’ll leave a review. Zero issues, controller is great, build quality is excellent, fast... I mean I can’t find anything to complain about but I have one"
2216,Dr.P,2020,5,"Excellent loading time of games and apps. Only about 5 games available for it so far. Graphics are not all that better than my original PS4, even with a TV that does 60fps and HDR. The menu isn't as convenient as the PS4's. The white color really sticks out in the room, which may be good or bad depending on your preference. For me, it doesn't match anything in my room or entertainment center. The PS5 has had a lot of crashing problems on release, whereas my Xbox Series X hasn't. A lot about the PS5 seems rushed in development to me. The Astrobot game it comes with however is a really nice game with impressive graphics and controls showing off the new controller, better than most of the games you can buy for it on release, so that was  really nice surprise."
2217,Phil,2020,5,"Very happy i managed to preorder one back in September and get it on launch day. My PS5 has been running perfectly so far. The new controller is the best Sony has ever produced, the new rumble features are cool...but it's the adaptive triggers i think will impress me more in the future. (if developers actually implement it)The system itself is VERY large and unfortunately needs the stand to even lay down horizontally because of it's weird shape. I really can't wait for the PS5 Slim that should be out in a few years. While it's a matter of opinion, the PS5 is overall an aesthetically ugly console, it's large and overally designed in my view. But i am overall bias towards simple designs. BUT, regardless of looks...it's a solid gaming system and i'm hyped for all those future exclusives!*TO THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT STOCK*:To the people complaining about stock....honestly... just be patient. Eventually stock will be replenished and there will come a time when you'll be able to just walk into a GameStop or Bestbuy and get a PS5. (within the next few months most likely). Don't give scalpers your money over the hype of the system and the holidays, go get a Switch Lite and a bunch of games or something and ride it out. Distract yourself until availability returns to normal. ALSO, as someone with a PS5...there isn't really much to play on it at the moment either way (I'm mostly playing older PS4 games on it at the moment). And all the real big titles aren't out until 2021 and beyond anyways. So it's actually more lucrative to wait it out. The time will come, just like every other console that was hard to find at launch were they'll be commonly found everywhere in due time.Don't stress out over a gaming machine or pay double or more for a system that will most likely become available within a few months next year."
2218,David A ,2020,1,Scam very over priced
2219,Amazon Customer,2020,1,Wtf ass
2220,Roberto Rosario,2020,1,No excuses for this pricing
2221,muthanna Alhamadani,2020,1,"This is crazy , 3 times the price paid for the device"
2222,DawgPhart ,2020,5,"I find it funny people are giving terrible reviews of a product they can't get their hands on. While I agree it's a frustrating situation, it's hardly a reflection of the product itself. That being said, I managed to secure a preorder back in September and it was delivered 8am launch day. I fired it up and downloaded the updates and purchased some digital content. While I'm going strictly digital this generation, I ended up getting the disc version just because. From the start it's an obvious evolution of the PlayStation console.PROS------- DualSense is a revolutionary input device, much like the N64 controller was. AstroBot is an incredible showcase- Faster and more responsive UI- Faster download speeds- PS4 games are optimized- Incredibly quietCONS------- Limited onboard storage (667GB usable), cannot offload or store to external device (yet).- Slightly buggy; froze a few times and scared the crap out of me. Weekly updates are promising.- Pretty massive in terms of size; may not fit in current entertainment systems- No VRR (yet)The system feels truly like an upgrade. Whereas my PS4 Pro would sound like an industrial fan when running Ghosts of Tsushima or Monster Hunter World requiring me to use headphones to drown out the noise, the PS5 maintains a nearly silent presence in my room. I really cannot wait for everyone to be able to get their hands on one and experience the system first hand. I feel your frustrations. I remember waiting 8 months to get my hands on thee PS3. Please be patient and don't fall prey to the scalpers."
2223,Tyler ,2020,4,Have loved it so far! So glad I got my hands on one. Only thing is I’ve had a couple of problems with it crashing here and there. I’m sure it’ll be fixed in updates as they continue to push them out. But overall amazing console. Smooth and fast.
2224,James & Tina,2020,5,If you are STILL having trouble finding a PS5 at retail price then its your own fault.  Put some effort into it and you can get one.FYI - The HDMI 2.1 cable needs to be about 4 feet longer if you're installing on a flush wall-mounted TV so you may need a longer HDMI 2.1 cable.  If you dont already have a 6ft+ cable then you should get one.
2225,obamaspotify,2020,5,Amazing console love it
2226,R. Ace,2020,1,"No, just no."
2227,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"I was fortunate to get a preorder on a Ps5 and so far it has been everything I’ve expected. Little to no load times and everything looks amazing. The feel of the controller is great as well, I know they’re hard to find right now but whenever you can get your hands on one, I highly recommend"
2228,william gerber,2020,4,I like the speed of downloads and the new controller. I don't like the fact that they don't have many new games to play. It kind of sucks to be playing old games on a new system.
2229,Gib,2020,5,NEXT GEN BABY! CONSOLE CONTROLLER IS ALREADY GOAT STATUS! WOO!
2230,JEAN MARIE LAURORE,2020,1,this is the lowest of low dont go for it
2231,L. M,2020,5,Got all the hos tryna play
2232,Noah Maples,2020,5,"Awesome console. The graphics are really nice, the Dualsense adaptive feedback and Haptic triggers add immersion to the gameplay. Miles Morales Spider man is a lot of fun and trims our some of the fat of the original and Astros Playroom is an excellent controller showpiece. It also plays ps4 game greats and makes your games look a little nicer if you never owned a ps4 pro like me. The console is totally worth the $500 if you can find one lol."
2233,Spartan,2020,1,Too high of a price for what could be a faulty unit. Seen too many issues people having with the ps5 from overheating to crashing to pay 1300.
2234,Agteyiiccvjk,2020,3,I’ve played this and the new xbox.  Xbox wins.  This is only marginally better than the last PS.  Save you money.
2235,Big_Ken_115,2020,1,"Unless it’s MSRP, don’t waste your breath. I’d rather waste that kind of money on the lotto then buy an overpriced console. Thank you scalpers for destroying what little faith in humanity I had left and for ruining the happiness of kids everywhere this Christmas."
2236,Michael T,2020,1,Don't give in to it. Its ridiculous!
2237,Cassie Moran,2020,5,The best purchase I’ve made!
2238,Carlos Solis,2020,5,"Incredible console best I’ve ever owned worth the wait, fast load times, 4K player is great, great cooling system, exclusives that actually matter what can I say? And to those who are bitter that they don’t have one ? Be reasonable we are in a pandemic and this was easy to obtain if you follow these things ahead of time, you only have yourself to blame if you don’t have one."
2239,Jocelyn Rodriguez,2020,5,My son loves it. We got lucky and were able to purchase right after we got the Amazon notification on launch day 😁 so far no problems.
2240,David Guido ,2020,5,"Glad I’m getting the bugs out for future owners, love my system, not enough room to keep games you play mostly multiplayer and single player experience, ssd storage needs to get green lighted, but I’m managing. 1st world problems. Don’t get a system from anywhere that can’t give you a legitimate receipt because if your system needs service you need to include a copy of your receipt for service in the past this was the case with ps3. I sent a few ps3’s in for service to sony."
2241,Elian,2020,5,Its absolutely amazing the fresh UI gives it the new gen feel along with great launch games to play right away along with the big AAA games coming out next year exclusively on Playstation!
2242,Igotmine,2020,5,The reviews from people who are mad they didn't get one are hilarious!!! This thing is the best system I've ever owned!!
2243,Roman,2020,5,"Great console with a few bugs, but those will be worked out in the coming moths as the norm with new hardware."
2244,RMR,2020,5,"Beautiful, powerful console. Hope everyone can get one soon"
2245,Ismatu Koroma,2020,5,I absolutely love the PS5 I actually got it for my brother but I spend enough time with him that I play it often or stream on it as well. It’s been great and he loves it because my brother has it to so they both play it. Sony really out did there self with this.
2246,Abel Dagne,2020,5,Its just a really good console!
2247,Sam Tib,2020,5,"Wow....just....wow. I really expected the Xbox to compare, but my buddy (who has it) is still fuming at the blatant differences. Sony, nice job!"
2248,Mohammad F Ghauri,2020,5,
2249,Jordi,2020,5,Great system! Scalpers really ruined the launch but I managed to get myself one and it’s pretty great.
2250,Dion,2020,5,All the one star reviews are butthurt people who couldn't get a console. The system is great. It feels next gen and I'm sure it will only set itself more apart from previous gen as time goes on and new features are added or tweaked. It's loads fast and is visually appealing although it is very large. The only complaint is the internal storage is small. I live in an area where internet has a data cap (these companies are getting out of control) and so being able to delete and redownload games all the time is not ideal because one game is typically 50-100 gb and the internet is capped at 1.2 tb
2251,Nando007,2020,5,GGWP ps5 good
2252,Trusty Rombone,2020,5,plays youtube good too
2253,Jerry ,2020,3,"I've been playing Playstation for as long as I can remember. My family's first system from Sony was the PS2, which was a lot of fun as a kid. Years later, I am still getting a lot enjoyment out of my new PS5.The system is great. Performance is better than anything I've played on yet. Worth every dollar.If you're on the edge about upgrading from your PS4 there are some things to consider:- Backwards compatibility ( you can play most PS4 games on your new PS5, disk and all). Purchasing PS4 games from the PS Store is possible. You are also still able to join parties and play games with your friends who have PS4 consoles. It's almost like having both systems in one!- More power and speed. Your games load MUCH faster. Some load times are non-existent. Graphics are amazing. You can enjoy games and shows in 4K if your tv is capable of it. Switching between games and navigating the main menu is seamless; everything takes little to no time at all.- New controller. The controller is new and improved. The adaptive triggers are a neat little addition, although I don't use them because they will put in at a disadvantage in competitive gaming; it's still fun in a single player / co-op experience though. The HD Rumble feature isn't new to me since it's also on Switch, but it definitely improves the experience.- Free game upgrades. There are some games that allow you to upgrade from PS4 to PS5 versions. If you have the disk version then you will have to keep the disk handy to continue playing the game.I haven't seen everything the PS5 can do yet since there aren't many games pushing it to it's fullest potential yet so there is more to come.One complaint that I had which isn't about the system itself, is Playstation's customer service. I ordered my system from Amazon a few days after the system launch and while unboxing it, I noticed that it didn't include a charger for the controller. I figured Sony just left the chargers out to save money (which made me upset at first), and I was going to go out to buy one until I remembered my Nintendo Switch remote came with a USB-C charger. I ended up using that one up until now.After watching an unboxing video, I saw realized my system was supposed to come with a USB-C charger, but I'm assuming it was mistakenly left out because Sony was rushing to get systems shipped out.I contacted Playstation support about it, and they told me they weren't responsible for it since it was sold through Amazon and told me to tell Amazon the issue. I then talked to Amazon, and they basically told me it was a manufacturer issue and I could buy an Amazon brand USB-C charger if needed. I was VERY disappointed at both of their responses, but more with Sony customer service because they put the product together and refused to help me. I am just lucky that I had a spare USB-C to use and I was able to play my system when I bought it.Moral of the story, the PS5 is a great system. Playstation Support not so much.(Edit: Amazon gave me $10 credit for the cord that was missing. Not exactly what I wanted, but it helps)"
2254,Chris Touch,2020,5,On time and great shape
2255,Alex,2020,5,Fast console
2256,Mark D,2020,5,"I have always had xboxes and figured I would switch it up for this nextgen. This thing is so incredible. It's fast, great picture quality and the controller is the best."
2257,Anthony Morris,2020,5,"I have every console of the last 20 years, this is by far the best!"
2258,Peter,2020,5,"Looking back at this, I am so glad that I pre-ordered the PS5. The quality is very nice and the first game I tried was NBA 2K21, which had AMAZING graphics"
2259,tyler serrano,2020,2,Was so happy to get my hands on one after waiting for it to release and i can’t even use it it shuts off completely when playing any game and i can’t seem to find a solution to this issue. No company has helped yet
2260,Christian,2020,5,"I tottally love this new console, the delivery was really good, the box was damaged (nothing serious) in one of the corners which had me worried during the unboxing, but everything was great. Thank you"
2261,Andra Haverstock,2020,4,"Overall the games look and play great, but 625 gb is not enough they need to enable the nvme drive soon, I don't like having to delete old games to make space for new ones"
2262,Johnny Clayton,2020,1,What a piece of crap 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
2263,Damion Jackson,2020,1,Trash price
2264,Amazon Customer,2020,1,Just wait a few weeks and buy it at suggested retail price. The money you save will make the wait worthwhile.
2265,Justin,2020,1,Dont fall for the scam
2266,CRS,2020,3,"Playstation 5 arrived, I was super excited to play it but unfortunatly it didnt have too many games to play. The console itself looks beautiful. Its an eyecatcher. Graphics are great and processing is good. I think it needs more games to play but for now its a so so for me. Not totally blown away."
2267,Jennifer s,2020,5,Lives up to the hype!! In my opinion the PS5 is the biggest upgrade Sony has made since the original PlayStation to PS2. Graphics and frame right are drastically improved but that will largely depend on your TV set. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are groundbreaking! The controller feels like an expensive piece of tech. Astros Playroom is really well thought out and highlights the features of the controller. It’s not just a “toss in” game. The triggers feel like real gun triggers in COD Cold War. Unfortunately the controller batteries don’t last long. I plan on getting an extra controller eventually to solve that problem. Has been a few glitches as expected for a new console. Nothing major. Hopefully Sony will be releasing more units ASAP and they get into actual gamers hands and not bots. Amazon was the only smooth transaction I had during the release. More retailers need to take action against bots. Wish more of my friends had PS5s to play against. Hopefully soon!
2268,Bruno,2020,5,"Great console if you can get your hands on one. Please don't buy from scalpers. I was lucky enough to score a pre-order from Amazon but if I hadn't I would wait until next year when stock levels normalize and would not pay any more than MSRP.I upgraded from the original PS4 and there is a very noticeable difference in image quality and load times. The UI takes some getting used to compared to PS4. The controller is great, bigger and heavier than Dualshock 4. The haptics are cool but not mind blowing. I'm curious to see how they can be used by game devs.The console is fairly large and imposing, which can be good and bad depending on who you ask. The aesthetic is definitely growing on me though.I think either Xbox and PS5 are great new gen consoles but I enjoy PS exclusives more."
2269,Eddie Conrad,2020,1,Did God bless this ps5?
2270,Justin g.,2020,1,What a POS. I hate whoever created bots!
2271,Jess,2020,4,"This is my first time getting a Playstation near the release date. I didn't know what to expect, but after a few weeks, I really am impressed.For one, games barely take any time to load. The remote it comes with has a microphone built-in, which is really cool to me. The audio that comes from it is also clear and again, simply cool. It also lets you play most PS4 games, and if you have PS Plus, they give you a free PS4 collection. It includes games like Detroit: Become Human, Uncharted 4, Ratchet and Clank, and God of War. It's a sweet deal.My only complaint is Share Play. With the PS5 having limited availability, my friend still has the PS4. We often play together through Share Play, as certain games of ours don't have online multiplayer. One example would be LEGO: Harry Potter. Unfortunately, a PS5 and PS4 cannot Share Play with each other. I figured PS5 games couldn't be shared, but PS4 games can't either. Neither system is capable of sharing with the other. I really hope this is fixed in the future, as it blocks me from playing a lot of games with my friend."
2272,M.J.,2020,5,I was able to preorder using the backdoor link that had been posted on twitter. I had no idea these were going on sale at the time but after finding the link I promptly made my purchase. Amazon didn't cancel my order and now I am a very happy gamer.
2273,dion,2020,5,"great console not perfect not to thrilled with they way you get back to home screen. a few bugs that will be worked out with system updates. what i like most about it is the controller and the games. PS5 is the true next generation console. if you can get your hands on one, you will be blown away with it"
2274,Andres,2020,5,It’s amazing
2275,Edwina Mitchell,2020,5,I love this consol. It is a power house with tons of exclusive games coming out.
2276,F. C.,2020,5,Total heaven for gamers. shipping for the pre-order is super on time. Love it.
2277,Abe2001,2020,5,So happy I purchased this. The graphics a really good. My games feel more real to me.Much faster than my old ps4. Worth the upgrade
2278,Seriously sony?,2020,1,After less than a month of playing... my controller now has stick drift. I keep my stuff very clean and do not eat while gaming. Back to Xbox?
2279,Conner Lewis,2020,5,"This thing is absolutely amazing, can’t believe I was able to get my hands on one!"
2280,snapple,2020,5,"The system is what you expect in NEXT GEN. The haptic controller is something to experience, reminds of the first Wii experience. However, Spidey feels like DLC and Demons is a remake. There really is NO game on the market worth the hassle and price to get this unit RIGHT NOW. Don't overpay, be patient and wait for the games to arrive.Also, I'd recommend the digital version as the disc drive is rather loud. Louder than PS4."
2281,Stan,2020,5,thank you amazon for making me happy
2282,Mrs. Shelby,2020,1,Heck no people should be ashamed this price is ridiculous
2283,Stephen W. Jones,2020,1,Was playing for about 3 hours and when i cut the game off finally it never worked again. Had to contact Sony to get them to fix/replace it. In the process of sending it to them now. Good Luck on Launch consoles if you guys get one.
2284,Anthony Hernandez,2020,5,Amazing Console. Love it!
2285,Victor ,2020,5,Next Gen!
2286,Vincent G,2020,5,So happy with my Playstation 5 and it is super quick and the quality is unmatched.
2287,Justin Durr,2020,5,Easy set up with a great UI. Slight buzzing from fan other than that it’s super quiet
2288,WLouie,2020,5,"I put it next to my 55 inch TV and now it looks like it shrank down to the size of a computer monitor.Graphically, it's a small leap over the PS4 Pro. Gone are the 10x performance generational leaps in home consoles. We are hitting a brick wall with graphical fidelity. For those of us who remember the way we felt when we moved from PS1 to PS2.. then PS3.. this will not be like that. PS5 is just over 2x more power than PS4 Pro.My kids love the PS5, so it gets 5 stars!"
2289,Savannah Friend,2020,5,"This is an incredible machine. Certainly, a must-have in next-gen gaming. Dual Sense controller provides an immersive experience that is unmatched and unrivaled."
2290,Darth Báäl,2020,1,Lol. Sham at this price.
2291,lea,2020,5,"I signed up for a notification from Amazon for a ps5 when I failed to secure one via preorder and on launch day Amazon sent me a notification and I clicked on it and it went straight to checkout and I got it without any problems (thanks Amazon). As for the ps5 it’s leaps and bounds better than the ps4 in every aspect, I love it and it works great."
2292,TechHead,2020,5,Incredible load times and boot times. Mostly playing ps4 games on here and it's a significant upgrade. Load times are incredible and games have no lag or memory issues. Lightning is improved and games that offer faster frame rates and hdr look much better than ps4. Only played 2 ps5 games and they are impressive though it is still early days as most games are really just upgraded ps4 games. I got this more as a hardware upgrade as there aren't must play ps5 games yet though that is just around the corner a year from now. And the price is steep for a $500 console but considering how much better it is than a dedicated gaming pc at $1200 it is a bargain.
2293,Frank Rodriguez,2020,5,Awesome
2294,Otoniel,2020,5,"I managed to get my console in the pre order, is bigger than expected but it looks like alien technology. also the controller is a massive win by Sony, my favorite controller so far"
2295,EDHOLLA ,2020,5,"I got mine from Amazon after worrying so much. I thought I was going to get screwed out of one. I know how hard it is to get one because of COVID. If you’re on the fence don’t worry buy a PS5. The console and graphics are the amazing considering the low price compared to a PC. The controller is now my new favorite gaming controller. I don’t know how to explain it but I was completely blown away by it. I recommend playing Astro Bot Playroom that you get as a free download. I don’t usually like those type of games but it really impressed me. The stuff that game does with the controller had me and my friend laughing in joy. The console also has a great lineup of launch titles that are far superior to what the PS4 and Xbox one had. Also, it’s considerably better than what the Xbox Series X & S offer at launch. I don’t think it’s even comparable to be honest. The console has backwards compatibility with all PS4 games which is awesome(minus a couple obscure titles). I really am seriously impressed by the PS5 and it far exceeded my expectations. I recommend buying one if you can find one. The service from Amazon was also great thankfully."
2296,Ershaid Alrashaidi,2020,5,Best console ever made!.
2297,Jonathon E. Stark,2020,5,UI is outstanding and SSD is blazing fast. So happy I was lucky enough to get one.
2298,David Carcamo,2020,4,"I love the ps5 but the controller dies rather quickly in my opinion, so that’s why I’d say buy an extra control or the rechargeable stand."
2299,Austin Terry,2020,5,Everything SONY told us and MUCH MUCH more
2300,Axel Laza,2020,5,"Love the console style really enjoyed playing ""Spiderman"" game .Amazon confirmed order was on point and on time .Thank You Amazon for permitting me get an hold of and hard to get item."
2301,Jose Martinez,2020,5,It’s lit
2302,Tyler,2020,5,"Lot Fast then the PS4, it has a interesting shape, the DualSense is amazing on what it can do. PS5>Xbox Series X"
2303,Markus Garcia,2020,5,"I love it. Major upgrade from the PS4. Graphics, sound, networking all great"
2304,jaime ruperto,2020,4,Beast of a console
2305,itsjayk,2020,5,"Despite other people not being able to pre order the console due to scalpers, I however enjoy and grateful of how lucky I was to play the PlayStation 5. Those who are still trying to get one, good luck and don’t buy one from one of the scalpers. It’s not worth it and I’m sure Sony will sell more next year but this time it will be for consumers to play. Not lowlife scalpers that try to make profit off a company because they’re lazy af"
2306,A,2020,1,Price... thumbs down
2307,Kyle,2020,5,Love it so far
2308,Yuval bachar,2020,5,Arrived quickly. The PlayStation box itself was a bit ripped which was weird but everything was fine and working
2309,Matthew Cantellano,2020,5,The PS5 is just great. I love the new triggers!!!
2310,Courtney,2020,5,"Noticed a lot of 1 star reviews from people who didn't get the product. I got this for $500, I saw it randomly get stock for $1,600 on release day and figured it was someone trying to resell their stock, maybe by someone who got their pre-order. I got lucky and while fighting with walmarts website I happened to check Amazon and saw it on sale for $500 and got it on release day. It arrived not even 2 days later (I have prime).The product itself is wonderful, runs fast and smoothly, I'm in love with the remote, and been trying to find an excuse to play it everyday. Love that I can play ps4 games on it cause there aren't a lot of ps5 games out yet, so if you didn't get the ps5 yet, don't worry, breathe, you're not missing a ton of games so far."
2311,Kenny,2020,5,"I've been gaming for 30 years! So it's no surprise that I sat up on pre-order night refreshing my my browser. I got the disc version, charging station and COD CW. PS5 is awesome on our 55"" 4k LG OLED TV @120hz (see screenshot for proof). The controller is amazing. The operating system gives PC like options. You can change performance settings, etc. This blows away my expectations. It is work $500 easily! #deathofPCgaming"
2312,Mike,2020,5,Great product.  Runs much smoother than ps4.  I’m glad I was able to get a preorder before they sold out.
2313,iMacMan,2020,5,This is a great gaming console. If you’re into PlayStation games you’re going to love this. The obvious issue right now is supply. Just keep trying online and hopefully you will be able to get one.
2314,Joel Gacuma,2020,5,The graphics on the ps5 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 can't wait for other games. This is console definitely the future of gaming 😁
2315,Justin Bryan Siao,2020,5,Processing and delivery by Amazon went as great as I could've hoped for.The unit works really well - I haven't experienced any faults with it and Sony really delivered in their own right.
2316,Alonte Griffin,2020,1,I received mine broken. It would not even turn on smh. Spent 500 for the thing to not turn on. Not even once for me.
2317,Kenny S.,2020,5,"Best console on the market, an kudos to Amazon for delivering on launch day. Thank you!"
2318,Cody gerber,2020,5,Awesome gaming console! Love playing godfall. Graphics are great! A must have!
2319,Troi,2020,3,"The good: First off, super glad I got the disc version. It does take all of my PS4 games and I haven't had a single problem with any of them playing. I do like the preloaded Astroboy game which helps explain the new features of the dual sense remotes by taking you through a super mario style game. I also like that you can lay the PS5 down or stand it up (if you have room!) and it comes with a little stand to make sure you have appropriate airflow. The outside white plates are easily removed for custom designing.The bad: The design just sucks IMO. It looks like Sony tried to take a wifi router and cross it with an xbox. I also find the height of the PS5 to be problematic in fitting in my usual entertainment places. There are several bugs reported which I have experienced two errors myself. The front USB outlet on the PS5 is NOT chargining the controllers. It doesn't matter if it's in rest mode or plugged in during play. There is power going to it according to the light change and I've been able to update the remote through the USB. The controller also had a tendency to lag after several hours of play.  I've noticed after pressing a button there is no response and if you press it again it will finally register the first button push. This has occurred with the directional arrow buttons and the shape buttons of the controller that came with the console and on a second controller that I bought separately. The only way to fix it seems to be to plug it back into the USB, unplug it, and play with the second remote for a little bit then switch back. The voice assistant is annoying and Sony makes harder than it needs to be just to find where to disable it. If the voice only said menu titles then it would be fine but it reads every little detail including ""to access press x"" etc. The lack of themes is also annoying as I have several limited edition themes only my PS4 that can't carry over. The main menu is always showing reels of people's shared games which I find to be useless. It would be nice if the main menu was actually the games installed instead of having to shift all the way to the end to look at your entire game library (the game switcher shortcut only shows recently played games).Basically, yes it's a new console with all the flashy bells and whistles but also a lot of bugs that need fixing. I know remembered why I tend not to buy new consoles on release day!"
2320,Johnathan,2020,5,Boxed well and finally arrived. An unreal item.
2321,Huihui91724,2020,5,I love this console. Been waiting for a long time to get it.  I have the Xbox series x also but I like this console better because of the games.  I think that the graphics are better and the choices of games are more better.
2322,Tasha Ransom,2020,5,2 day shipping thx Amazon purchased with no problems..
2323,Bethany S.,2020,5,Great console so glad amazon released it in a fair way.
2324,Janet,2020,5,A little over hyped but works like it should. The only thing i think is wrong with it is the disc noise overtime but thats it
2325,Christian Dimilta,2020,5,"Bought this for my secret boyfriend, was a hard purchase to hide from my current one, but all things are possible. I now get no texts back Bc he’s so busy playing this. Double edge sword for sure."
2326,Joshua Szpakowski,2020,5,"I got this system when Amazon sneakily put it up during a Walmart scheduled stock. I must say that this system is a tremendous upgrade from the previous generation of consoles. The controller with its updated rumble and the addition of adaptive triggers is fantastic to use! There is no real way to describe the triggers on it. The gameplay from COD and Miles Morales I have played looks and feels great. I have yet to find any downside during gaming. This is a monster in terms of size, so make sure you have a place to put it if you do find one!"
2327,Raging Noobie,2020,5,Way better than xbox.
2328,Mario,2020,5,"Fui afortunado al lograr comprarla en la segunda tanda que habilitó Amazon, tardó unos días en llegar a Colombia, me encontraba muy ansioso ya a la vez asustado por tanta noticia de fallos en la entrada hdmi, sonido fuerte del ventilador entre y en el peor de los casos, que me llegará un ladrillo en reemplazo de la consola, esperaba que no fuera uno de los desafortunados.  Por fin la tengo en mis manos, me encontraba asustado, al destaparla me deslumbró su belleza, al conectarla me encuentro que es un producto de calidad, bien fabricado, demasiado silenciosa, veloz y fresca, llevo horas jugando y no tengo problema alguno, excelente consola, del control ni hablar, es algo fuera de este mundo, si calidad en la construcción y su vibración 3d es de lo mejor que sony ha fabricado a la fecha.Saludos desde la ciudad de Cali - Colombia"
2329,Phylicia04,2020,5,"I can’t believe how easy this was for me to purchase. I had set ‘in stock notifications’ a few weeks before the launch and I was making dinner and got a notification on my phone around 6pm. Checked, it was in stock, swipe, click, here in two days!"
2330,Vanessa,2020,5,I've been waiting for this and it finally came and It came as expected. love the features and specs.
2331,mazhar,2020,5,BEAST of a Console!! Extremely quiet and it plays PS4 games better than the PS4 does. PS5 games look amazing in 4K although most are 60 FPS.
2332,Jon,2020,5,Had my PS5 for 2 weeks now and it is Amazing! Graphics are great an load times are almost nonexistent also the PS5 is super quiet which is a big upgrade from ps4 lol. Duelsense is a game changer cannot wait to see how devs take advantage of it in the future.
2333,Tishismyname,2020,5,"Worth the wait! Great piece of hardware. Silky smooth UI, lighting fast load times, true 4K gaming experiences, and industry influencing innovations. The controller just feels right in your hands and this is before you experience the amazing features it adds to games. Astrobot is best pack in game of a new console. Highly recommend Playstation 5 and can't wait for developers to utilize this technology moving forward."
2334,RunnerKim,2020,5,"I want to start out with pure transparency, I felt like I won the lottery when I was miraculously able to purchase the PS5 console on 11/12.  (It's been two weeks and I still can't believe it.) After spending the entire day cycling through every website that I could find that claimed they'd have inventory, I hit the Amazon page at the right split-second at 9:00PM. A few tears of joy may have been shed.It arrived on 11/14 and I haven't used my television since. My teen is constantly screaming things like ""LOOK HOW FREAKING FAST THAT JUST LOADED!"" or shoving the remote in my hand and forcing me to experience the ""incredible haptic feedback!"" for myself and endlessly carrying on about amazing frame-rates.  I don't know a frame rate from a bucket of mud, but my kid is thrilled...I was kidding, I actually HAVE watched tv with the new console and the available apps are very cool. We were able to get some new ones that our older smart-tv no longer supported, so that was nice. And it's true, everything does load lightning fast. So far it doesn't support streaming from our personal home server and that is a negative.I realize that most people were not lucky (I know it was luck and no skill on my part!) like I was on the 12th and I agree, this was a TERRIBLE roll-out that neither SONY nor any of the retailers handled well. There is no excuse for how poorly it was orchestrated. I understand the rage. Having said all that, although the console is ugly in my opinion, it is a fantastic gaming system. My teen obsessively researched the PS5 for the past six months and he has not been disappointed with it.  GOOD LUCK TO YOU IN YOUR PS5 PURSUIT!!!"
2335,Mane043,2020,5,The product is safe and working!
2336,Joel,2020,5,"This system is great. The only downfall might be the limited internal storage, but adding an external hard drive to store ps4 games helps a ton."
2337,A.W. Morton,2020,5,"Product was well packaged, swiftly delivered, and plays all my old ps4 games at lightening speed. Haven't purchased a ""next-gen"" game as of yet. I'm currently avoiding use of an external hard drive and ""rest"" mode until they patch the supposed problems with those features. This thing is NOT as big as everyone is making it out to be, it is whisper quiet, and I haven't had a single issue. Played it for about 20 total hours so far."
2338,THE MASTER,2020,2,"Everything seems to crash on this system. Call of duty crashes all the time. Playing zombies it crashed so hard the system shut off and have to rebuild the hd. Demons souls has crashed 2x on me so far. The actual o/s crashed just reading a message from someone. Fortnite crashed a few times as well. Checking the net, I am not alone. Seems like pretty much all the launch titles crash to some degree. Some more than others. Waiting to see if there are any updates soon. I fear the hardware might just be flawed."
2339,Ari Karim,2020,1,System continually crashes.
2340,Matt Ebs,2020,5,This console has been a pleasant step up from my (jet-engine) PS4 Pro. I've finally regained some sanity back (from excessive fan sounds) and the graphics are BEAUTIFUL. It's only going to get better from here
2341,Tyris Eddings,2020,5,Have had every generation of the PlayStation and am happy Amazon had stock when pre order came out. Loving the system so far no complaints.
2342,Chris S,2020,1,"I was lucky enough to get a pre-order for a PS5 and was obviously excited to get it on launch day, but that went down the drain when I received the order. First of all, when it was delivered, the box was WIDE OPEN. Second, it has NO PROTECTION around it. It was just a brand new PS5 in a big, banged-up box that was on a delivery truck more than likely moving around for 2 days. After seeing all that, I setup the PS5 and everything seems to be working fine, and then I see pixels all over the screen and I can no longer run any games. I don't know if it was a result of how bad the protection was or if my PS5 console just had issues out the box, but I basically had a busted PS5 for the entire weekend. Trying to figure this out, I told Amazon and everyone I talked to was very unwilling to help. I basically had to keep calling PlayStation support until someone helped me fix the issue (which was send it in for repairs). What should have been an awesome weekend turned into what felt like a $500+ mistake and I will never buy a launch console from here again since that's how they treat their Prime customer."
2343,Stwart Pena,2020,5,This is truly Next-Gen Gaming
2344,illiterati,2020,5,"The best PlayStation I’ve ever owned. Hopefully it lasts. Smooth gameplay, fast loading times. Great game interface. It’s massive so figure out your placement. I have it standing for better cooling. Thank you Amazon for having it available!"
2345,Bdbeep,2020,5,"(Did not come with controller cover). Not nearly as heavy as I thought. Super fast delivery as well, got here a day early! Controller has a nice heaft to it and the buttons are smooth,  definely get a controller cover as the white will catch dirt easy. Also comes with a stand!!"
2346,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Great
2347,elvin,2020,5,"I got this on release day.  The first notable thing you will notice is the size.  It IS big, but it is like that for a reason.  To keep it silent.  The console is very quiet.  You can really only hear it when a disc is being installed.  That is when the fans turn on a bit and the drive makes noise.  Anyways, I will list pros/cons.Cons:- Big(some don't care, and its size serves a purpose)- no VRR yet. (No variable refresh rate for games yet.  Sony said it is coming in a firmware update)- Cannot use PS4 controllers(a con to some, but the reason is that Sony went for innovation with the Dualsense.)- DualSense battery life - most report it at around 7-12 hours.  Sometimes lower, like in Astro bot which uses all features all the time mostly.  I wish the battery lasted longer overall.- Barebones UI compared to current PS4 UI - Lot of stuff has changed, like the quick access menu.  The display settings are not as extensive as the new Xbox also.  Lots of Apps are missing.  HDR always on, even in UI(you can turn it off completely if want though, but will also affect games).- No Internal or external storage expansion yet for PS5 games.  This is coming in a firmware update they say.There are other stuff too like no optical port, needing an adapter for VR, etc.  The ones I listed came to mind first.Pros:- Nearly 100% BC with PS4 games.  A lot have upgrades too.- Innovative controller - Haptic feedback/adaptive triggers/built-in mic/longer battery than DS4/etc.  The controller is awesome battery life aside.- Better First-Party than Xbox.  Xbox has Halo/Gears/Forza/Fable, what else?  They bought Bethesda, but it will be years before those games are released.  Then there is the fact that even Bethesda said they might appear on other consoles.  PS is known for its great first-party games.  Gran Turismo/God of War/The Last of Us/Spider-Man/KillZone/Uncharted/etc.- Very Quiet.  It is large, but the good thing is that it is super quiet.- Official internal storage expansion.  When it is updated you will be able to upgrade to higher memory storage.  The greater thing is that third-party drives will work.- Much faster internet speeds than PS4.  It is not even comparable.- 3d audio - sounds great.  Much better than what we had on PS4.Much much more that I will not go into since most people know a lof it.  I focused on the cons for those in doubt about their purchase."
2348,Sherrell,2020,5,Sleek design. The transfer of my games and other data was seamless.
2349,Mhmoud,2020,5,10/10
2350,Leonardo Contreras,2020,4,I love my PS5 but I was never given an option from Amazon to purchase insurance or protection plan for my device. Is it still possible to get it?
2351,Amazon Customer,2020,1,Playstation just like xbox have the worst supply inventoryThese consoles were announced a year ago they couldve easily made more or at least held off on the unveil until they both had enough inventory
2352,Chase,2020,4,"Got my system on launch day and couldn't be happier. Load times for PS5 games are super quick (within 2 seconds), and loading for the PS4 games that I've played on it are pretty much cut in half. I also love that I don't hear any noise coming from it. My PS4 sounded like a jet engine but this is quiet as a mouse for now. The way the PS Store is implemented is great as well.I do wish that they had kept the friends activity feed like the PS4 had and chat is now a little weird to figure out. The size is also a little awkward. Overall its a solid system and I'd recommend it. If you can get one then definitely grab Demon's Souls and Miles Morales, they're great."
2353,Zach Medeck,2020,1,"I hate giving out 1 stars but recieved a PS5 that won't power on, took 6 hours of calling Sony non-stop to even get out into a queue to wait to speak to a rep and now am stuck waiting 4-8 weeks for Sony to fix the dead console.Took Sony a week just to finally ship out a cardboard box they require me to send it back in rather then just email me a shipping label and let me use my own box. Still waiting on that box to arrive...Absolutely terrible launch support by Sony.To Amazon's credit they did every effort within their power to make things right but no inventory ties thier hands somewhat."
2354,Brian,2020,5,Great console. This console really feels like a next gen experience with the nice graphics and all the new features in the controller that comes with it. Loving it and can’t wait for a great generation to come!
2355,Matthew Puente,2020,5,Everything you ever wanted out of a gaming console. Would recommend 5/5
2356,Michael Al-Moustafa,2020,5,The best console!! The SSD is amazing. Must buy
2357,Shane M,2020,5,"There is nothing not to like a out this. Impossible to find but I found one and it’s a HUGE improvement over my launch day PS4 that sounded like it was going to explode any second. It took over 2 minutes sometimes to enter or invite people to a party chat or do simple menu things.I can enter or invite into a party chat in under 3 seconds as what you click on works right away.Can’t wait to see where this goes and what they do with 4K gaming, 120+ frames and the haptic feedback on controller!"
2358,Reggie,2020,4,"Observations after roughly one week of owning the PS5:- Can use my Sony TV remote to pause/play movies and control subtitles on the PS5- Disc is hot after running a 4K blu-ray movie (watching in roughly 30min to one hour spurts of the Harry Potter collection currently)- Dolby Vision is not supported- Startup time for games: 5-10 seconds from inserting the disc; usually, 5 seconds or less to load a game after reaching the title screen- Demon's Souls crashed twice in the Nexus shortly after loading the game so far; patch installed a few days ago, no crashes since then.  (rare) slight stuttering of 60 FPS framerate in certain areas.  game froze a couple of times on me in random areas with no enemies around.- Spiderman Miles Morales runs flawlessly so far with 0 crashes or freezes- NBA2k21: wow, words do not do the game justice in terms of realism other than a few obviously off parts: for instance, LeBron doing a shoulder shimmy celebration after dunking on someone (never seen him do this as a Laker)- Closing game through the PS5 app switcher and removing the disc before entering rest mode each day; no SSD corruption or rebuild issues thus far (fortunately) after multiple system updates."
2359,Jerrod Robinson,2020,4,Though lacking a lot of settings and features the Ps4 has at launch. The ones it does have are much improved and convenient to use thanks to the new SSD. Games load super fast and everything is easy to access.
2360,Rene Delgado,2020,5,"**Even though I was lucky enough to snag one for myself, I do hate that how this whole high supply demand issue happened bots shouldn't be able to clear out inventory that quick. We need a new 2VA for buying so the bots get cut out.**Official Review.It's an awesome piece of tech! I had every single ps console at one time and it gets better each time. The new updated controllers are comfortable in the hand. I like the mic in controllers, no more reason your team in any shooter game have no mic.The console itself is huge! Fast load ups. Heard of some systems had defects lucky for me I didn't have one. Sound coming off the system is non existent. Most all ps4 games can be played.  I connected my PSVr to it and it works smoothly as well. Highly recommend this console."
2361,Nicholas,2020,5,"I got it on launch day, delivery was fast. The console is very appealing to look at, the controller feels new and fresh compared to the PS4 controller, the haptic feedback is absolutely amazing, and the choice of launch games is also really good. If you are looking for a next gen console then I would choose this over the Xbox Series X which is more of the same. I would suggest getting a TV or monitor that is 120hz or more to get the full performance out of it. I am using a 1080 144hz monitor with HDMI 1.4 and it works great so you don't need an HDMI 2.1 capable display to use the PS5. If you want 4k 120hz then you need HDMI 2.1. It does not support 1440p monitors at the moment."
2362,Sam,2020,5,Amazing! Was able to successfully preorder console. Arrived ON release day. Love this system and it is everything I had hoped it would be. Happy gaming
2363,J. Manon,2020,5,Perfect piece of machinery. And Amazon made my pre order a smooth process 3rd console I pre ordered from them that I received at launch day
2364,David in FL,2020,5,"With these next gen console shortages everyone currently is experiencing, I am happy to say Amazon really came through.  I have been monitoring a number of sites over the past two weeks.  Thursday, around 9am ET, Amazon went live with another allotment.  I was lucky enough to grab one - website performance and speed was perfect - like any other purchase (unlike PS Direct, Walmart, GameStop, etc.).  Perhaps most surprisingly of all, it arrived SAME DAY.  I had it up and running by 9pm that same evening!First impressions:1.  Significant design improvement over the PS4.  Ventilation is vastly improved and is noticeably quieter, generating less heat.2.  Controller is world class.  Haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, audible responses, and sheer weight/feel of the controller is impressive.  Can't wait to see how games really take advantage of this with future titles.3.  User interface.  Much improved.  Menu graphics are sharper, overall more responsive.  I was never a fan of the PS3 & PS4 sterile menu system, this refined interface is a marked improvement.4. Day One Titles: Spiderman - great reference game to show off the console.  Demon Souls.  Wow.5. All my PS titles seem to work nicely (faster performance, usually).  Good backwards compatibility.6. Data transfer from PS4 to PS5 was simple and could be done in the background.Only real minor gripe is disk space.  These new next gen titles consume crazy amounts of disk space.  Plan on adding an external hard drive within 4 - 6 months of use, depending on your habits.  Sony could have done better in this area by enabling a second SSD at launch (The additional M.2 SSD slot is initially disabled and reserved for a future update). External drives work fine, just not as fast to load, etc.  (Pro tip, keep PS4 and older titles on the external drive.  Reserve newest titles for the built in ultra-high speed SSD).  Apparently no M.2 SSD manufacture can currently meet Sony's specs in terms of required performance, proper heatsink size, etc. to fit into the PS5.  Expectations this will get resolved in 2021.In summary, Sony did an impressive job with this new console.  You will be very pleased with the improvements. Stay vigilant with your search to obtain one.  A little extra monitoring of Amazon's PS5 console pages at the top of each hour might also prove useful.  :-)  You won't regret this purchase!"
2365,DangerWillRobinson,2020,5,"Had Xbox one after PS3 and I'm so happy to be back with Sony. The PS5 is amazing! It's bulky, yet sleek. It's super fast, yet quiet. The controller is a huge win for the PS5. If youre like me and didn't have a PS4, once you join playstation plus you get most of the big games that came outfl for ps4. I haven't even played a PS5 game yet because I wanted to catch up on all my faves from PS4 that I missed. If you're not sure between Xbox and PS5, choose PS5. You'll thank me later."
2366,The David,2020,5,Ignore all the low ratings from non-verified buyers. Stock was incredibly low and these consoles were near impossible to get.  People are rating out of rage instead of merit.I was lucky enough to score a Playstation 5 from Amazon on release day. I LOVE YOU AMAZON!!This system is a beautiful masterpiece. Everything is cleaners and smoother AND OH SO MUCH FASTER than the PS4. Games have NO load times. Example CoD Cold War to load a single player match of zombie mode took nearly 2 minutes for the PS4 version to load on my PS4 Pro. The PS5 version repeating the same process is literally 2.4  seconds to be ready to play. Even downloading games from PSN is much much faster.The only negative comment I can honestly make about the PS5 is the hard drive size. The wanted to make the system affordable and large SSD hard drives are very expense so they kept it under 1TB. As SSD prices fall in the future hopefully they release larger drives. PS4 games CAN be played now from external if you like. I installed multiple PS5 games and my most played PS4 and still have 200GB free so it's fine for the near future before juggling games becomes a thing.Currently 30 hours into Demon's Souls and so glad Amazon had stock on launch day!
2367,Drake Powell,2020,5,Made my kiddos Christmas for sure when we actually got it delivered a few hiccups along the way but the system works great and kid loves it!
2368,"Catherine in Largo, FL",2020,5,Great item and so happy didnt have to wait in a line.
2369,John Vasquez,2020,5,What can I say? Its amazing
2370,Julia,2020,5,"Incredibly happy about my purchase. Came next day no problem, which I thought was impossible but Amazon pulled it off!! I'm very impressed with how fast it got to me and the best part is that it works great! Good luck to everyone else."
2371,Daylon Holmes,2020,5,Love the PS5 5 mins in!!!
2372,j. user,2020,5,"I got a ps5, and was really lucky to do so. All I have for the console are praises. It works (almost) perfectly, is really quiet, and looks pretty good too. All the negative reviews I have seen are because they cannot get one. I understand that it is difficult to buy a ps5 right now, but that isn't a reason to leave a negative review. Good luck to anyone who is trying, and I would recommend using the nowinstock forum for ps5!!"
2373,Latrelle,2020,4,"Couldn’t buy anywhere else, great system."
2374,clarence cabel,2020,5,Excelent product an i love it
2375,Alcerio,2020,5,THE TRUE NEXT GEN CONSOLE!!!
2376,Calicoolguy,2020,5,It’s brand new ps5 console.  Worked great.  Some good launch games.  Fast ssd.  Haptic feedback controllers rock.  Good start to new generation.
2377,adrian,2020,5,I have had 0 issues with it so far games are awesome specially if you have PlayStation plus you get the PlayStation collection of games for free and of course the controller on shooting games is a new experience that is awesome
2378,Shaneqa Stewart,2020,5,"Everyone complaining about scalpers.... simply get a auto page refresher. Then set the timer for 4sec.. Go to the PSDirect page  and let the refresher work it's magic and just come back checking every so often(you don't lose your position in queue if you refresh, so don't stress if you forget about the timer right away). I scored 1 today after trying to get 1 from Walmarts selling out in seconds.."
2379,C,2020,1,Nintendo switch is better.
2380,NasTraDooMis,2020,4,"Wrapped me ps5 in carbon fiber and did a little gears of war 3 theme to it. I even  put a GOW3 skull behind the Ps emblem . It was quiet the chore to wrap it due to the curvatures and it didnt turn out so hot, but not too bad until some other themed skinned covers come out. The ps5 i dont think is too honkin big as alot of peeps are freaking out about, i mean yea its big but whatever. The included Astros playground game is ok, i wasnt too overtly impressed, the new controls to me are a bit ""funky"". The annoying thing is there doesnt seem to be a way in game to turn off the music, or invert the controls. Oh, it doesnt appear that ps4 titles that are also available as a ps5 title say like call of duty cold war has a free upgrade from ps4 to ps5, they want an extra $10 to upgrade the ps4 version to ps5 :( , i had thought they were free upgrades, guess not unless it was just cod cold war title. I didnt check others yet like watch dogs legion.The new UI takes some getting use to,also there are no ps5 themes as of yet and ps4 themes no work. Dont forget to look into all the launch problems to avoid possibly bricking youre ps5, theres a new software update for the ps5. I did the initial setup and i had previously downloaded the update through sony and installed it from a usb stick just to be ""safe"" . No one knows for sure yet what exactly was in the update so who knows it there were any of the big issues fixed.*update*If you cheap out on a ps5 game and get the ps4 version cause free ps5 upgrade and you play for a bit on the ps4 youre game save for that game will not carry over to the ps5 version, once you update the game to ps5 you have to start all over again."
2381,K.C,2020,5,Amazon never lets me down!PS5 is the next generation of consoles!
2382,Alexander LaLonde,2020,1,Lol great launch sony
2383,Jesus and Cyndi,2020,5,"The PS5 is worth every penny.  The Graphics are Exceptional,  the controls and game play are so good. I can't believe how quiet it runs compared to my PS4 PRO. Load times are in 2-3 seconds,  literally.  When you respawn your back in the game in 3 seconds.  Installing and downloading takes moments versus 25-30 minutes. The PS5 is quiet,  fast ,beautiful and unbelievably crisp.  Welcome to Next Gen Gaming.  Hopefully everyone will be able to get some in stock and then truly see why it deserves 5 stars."
2384,Gargus,2020,5,"So far all I'd done is play demons souls on it but I'd been playing it everyday since it came out.The system is dead quiet. Even after 6 hours of playing I still never hear the system running.Controller feels really great and solid with pretty good battery life.The 4k uhd player is fantastic, I tested avengers endgame on it.Everything is snappy and responsive.Overall I am very happy with it."
2385,James,2020,2,A ton of bugs doesn't work half the time other half its crashing after a few minutes you should wait till Sony fixes its software issues until then its basically a ps4 pro because ps4 games are the only things working right
2386,chandler collins,2020,1,Sony is getting absolutely nothing done and is very unprepared for their own launch of ps5.... must be all Democrats at Sony
2387,ReJoyce,2020,1,"I think it is unconscionable to triple a price on a product, especially when parents are trying to get Christmas presents for their kids!"
2388,Gerald,2020,1,Aloha want to be rich trying to sell the ps5 more than 3 times the real price
2389,hyspace,2020,1,Sony knows that the demind is high but the don't want to sell too many consoles in day 1.Hardware is expensive at begining but will be cheap later. Selling game consoles is losing money instead of earning money for Sony at begining so they did not manufacture enough consoles.
2390,lothar590,2020,5,No issues
2391,Seth,2020,1,Sony and the retailers handling this debacle get 0 stars
2392,joseph C,2020,1,amazon has let me down so has sony  but go give little more it just I try chat with amazon customer service ask when go get more then would answer me and after Christmas if there know more playstation 5 by then go buy one from ebay
2393,Max Reiss,2020,1,"If Sony wasn't ready to launch the PS5 and needed more time, then they should've said that in the beginning."
2394,southernmel1st,2020,1,"Sony is a disappointment to business. Now, instead of buying the PS5....I am purchasing the new XBOX :) I'm super excited and will NEVER buy another sony product again. Good job Sony. You are failing."
2395,Ernest Marshall,2020,1,Trying to get this product is harder than getting tickets to San Diego comic con. I should not have to go through so much time effort and stress like a performing monkey in order to buy something.
2396,Efrain V.,2020,5,I got mine from Best Buy. But the review is the same. It works great. Only issue so far is Valhalla won’t perm install but every other game has. It’s a masterpiece. I’m used to the graphic quality due to Pc. But consoles have gone a long way since n64. Once you get yours you’ll love it. You’ll just have to relearn how to use it. The ui is completely different.
2397,David,2020,1,"The way that Sony and retailers like Walmart have handled the launch is insanely disrespectful to their customers. They've made no attempt at combating bots or treating faithful customers with any semblance or respect. They only care about making a dollar. Allowing scalpers to capitalize on their lax security by running bots to buy up all the ""limited stock"" to resell to the people who genuinely want to play games on their system. I suppose we know how much we're valued by these companies at least."
2398,De Nomolos,2020,1,"The black within white color scheme is a clear representation of the systemic racism found within these products. The black part, which does all the work, is being held captive by the white structure. This is blatantly racist. We must boycott."
2399,spkrmakr,2020,1,Sony needs to burn for this! No way in my 40+ years in business have I seen a worse release by any company. Sony? Never again!
2400,Jaime Rodriguez,2020,5,"One of the best console for gaming. Everything so far has been super,from the graphics and performance (fps and speed). If you have one congratulations to be one of the few to get it at launch or little after.now for those that are are still waiting just be patience because you will get one eventually. I know it's painful to wait but it will come back in-stock for you guys.Happy gaming everyone ;)"
2401,Dan.R,2020,1,WORST LAUNCH EVER!!!
2402,Jose Mena,2020,5,Simply amazing 👏
2403,Will Ryder,2020,5,Amazon is the only website that isn’t bot infested. It is your best bet at getting a PlayStation Five.
2404,Doug,2020,1,its a disgrace!!!should have been released earlier this year or after Christmas
2405,Kuro Soza,2020,1,"I was ready to pre-order, I enter my emails so I can get notified of the pre-order day, I say this was the absolute worse launch day in gaming launch history Sony failed on this 100%."
2406,Adrian Pelzer,2020,5,"Short load times, great graphics lots of fun. Don’t listen to bad reviewers giving this a 1. They are just mad they couldn’t get one. I no trouble securing one."
2407,nosympathy,2020,1,"There are a few tech companies that handle releases of new products very well. Like Apple for instance. They usually do a pretty good job even though I'm not a fan.This has been terrible. Not a single place has used any form of anti-bot tech at all. Notifications are never on time, if you can even get notified. It's 2020, things should not be this bad. Other smaller businesses for years have required captchas to place orders. Not any of the big guys!Maybe even with a captcha in place, i'd still get beat out for one. Which would be fine, at least it would feel like I had a fair chance. Right now, I doubt there are many people feeling this way. The ones who do manage to snag a console are just super lucky or they are scalpers.This big retailers don't care, but scalpers are the worst people to exist right now. Seeing these units go for $1800+ in some areas (like mine)  and as some other reviews mentioned, $1800+ can build a realllllly nice PC that will make the PS5 look like garbage. There is no way I'd buy a PS5 for that, it's just counter productive at that point. It's a really nice machine for $400-500, but that's where it stops."
2408,letier santana,2020,5,so excited to finally to play.
2409,Tommie McCabe,2020,5,"Great console, looks amazing! I Happened to be one of the lucky few to grab one on launch so grateful for amazon for providing it at retail in that short couple minutes it was available. I wish you all good fortune"
2410,Jordan Ryan,2020,5,Came on time and just everything I wanted!
2411,Jessica Wilson,2020,1,There are plenty of these already but I want to repeat that it's ridiculous how bad this launch has been.
2412,Lily,2020,5,"very smooth play, enjoyed it a lot. Not only playing the new released PS5 games, but play some other games on 60fps and a higher resolution, which is amazing."
2413,Ronald Anthony Bordoy,2020,5,"Notice how all the bad reviews are people complaining about either not getting a pre order or blaming sony for a mistake made by retailers.The console itself is great, no issues, plays games wonderfully at great performance much more noticeable than the ps4 pro. Get this console when its available, you wont regret, literally the controller alone puts it miles ahead of everything else out there."
2414,PolskaPride,2020,1,"I am so fed up with Sony and their so called ""customer service"".  It's obvious that the unit I received was defective.  I was told by several sources to have the console in a vertical position.  I set up the stand and secured it.  The first day, no problems but on the second day there was definitely a louder sound I heard coming from the console.  It wasn't exactly loud but I did not hear it on day one so I was a little concerned.  On day two the console froze to the point that I had to restart it numerous times.  It has been doing that ever since but more frequently giving me an error message.  The last time I played, it froze three times within a 40 minute span.  This is supposed to be a new console (was it?) and I am experiencing issues from the beginning.  At this point I say save yourself the aggravation and invest elsewhere.  Also, I did not know that this console would be so big!  It sticks out like a sore thumb because of its size and design.  Extremely disappointed.. this one is going to be returned shortly.  I guess the joke was on me, but not for long."
2415,Goodrats,2020,5,"I'm gonna keep this short for anyone thinking of picking up a ps5. I have a pc that i've spent over 2000 dollars building, it runs everything i throw at it on high settings. For 500 dollars the PS5 does some things faster and smoother then my expensive PC. You can not beat the performance and tech. that you get from the PS5 for the cost of 500 dollars. Not to mention the fact that the controller might be the most badass and most comfortable that I have ever used. If you do get a PS5 don't pass up hopping into the free game Astro's Playroom that comes with your console to see the potential the controller really has."
2416,angelo,2020,1,I SPEND 1300 FOR THIS CONSILE FROM EBAY...IT DONT WORK CRUSH AND CRUSH AGAIN..THE SELLER DOESNT EANT GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK..NEVER AGAIN..SORRY AMAZON
2417,carlos,2020,1,Sony you suck !!! A lot of children will be disappointed this Christmas.....
2418,Cuong D.,2020,5,"My kids are all over Astro's Playground. When they go to bed, my wife takes over with Assassin's Creed Valhalla. I bought this system for me and I feel as though I'm getting the short end of the stick here. The only thing I can do is watch them play. The haptic triggers are best demoed with the Astro's Playground game with the controller reacting to certain elements of gameplay. Valhalla does a good job of showcasing the great graphics and fast processing. How does it play? I don't know, ask my family. Oh, I've been asked to order another controller now and it's not for me. Lovely."
2419,Tedward,2020,5,It was amazing product. It definitely improves the loading time from switching between applications. Also very silent when playing games. One thing to keep in mind it is very large it can take up a pretty big amount of space
2420,Jason Mirabal,2020,5,speed / looks / controller ... awesome product and worth the wiat
2421,The Dude Abides,2020,4,"I didn't get mine on Amazon...I tried, but it disappeared from my cart every time.  Same with Walmart.  Best Buy was the worst (shocking, I know).  I got lucky and saw a link to Target and when I clicked on the link it took me to the app that had all of my wife's info already loaded - I added it and checked out within 15 seconds.  FedEx gets zero stars for their abysmal delivery...said I'd get it on 11/14, then they changed it to 11/15, then they changed it to 11/16, when I finally got it.  I'm boycotting them.Boy, it's really big.  Like I couldn't believe how big it was when I unboxed it.  Compared to the PS4, it's a monster.  I had it mounted vertically, but it was too distracting and I'm not going to stick it in a cabinet, so it's horizontal now, even though it looks better upright.  But I guess being really big makes it really fast.  And when I say fast, I mean it.  I have AT&T fiber with 1000 up/down, but downloading on my PS4 was insanely slow, even with a fast, wired connection.  Downloading Warzone to the PS5 took a few minutes - on PS4, it took an hour at least, if not longer.  Downloading system and game updates take seconds.  I'm guessing it has a faster internet card in it, but the writing time to the SSD is lightening quick.  Then there's the load times for games - I mean, I don't have a lot of time.  I have 3 kids, 2 dogs, am married....if my wife goes up to take a shower, I'd bust out the PS4 controller and try to get in a few MW matches and half the time, I'd fire it up and have to do an update, and load the game, and join a lobby and by time I got into a match, she'd be back downstairs.  That's not going to be the case with PS5.  Updates, fast.  Boot up, fast.  In game, fast.  Actually have a shot of some pew pew in those 20 minute timeslots.The CONTROLLER!!!!  So, you get Astro's playroom for free.  My kids love it, first off.  It really does show off the capabilities of what the controller can do - it's Super Mario-esque.  Very cool to play around with once or twice though.  I bought COD as my first game.  I have to say, on campaign mode, it really adds to the experience.  Each gun (so far) has a totally different feel to it.  When you pull a trigger on a real gun, there's an initial wiggle before you catch the spring - and that's the case in this game too.  And with each gun I've tried, the trigger pull feels a little different.  But, for MP, I feel like it's a disadvantage.  You squeeze those triggers and have to be very deliberate because of the resistance, so in MP, where you have to react quickly, esp if you play hardcore like me, I think it's a disadvantage.  I haven't looked to see if it can be turned off, but I think you can.  One thing about the controller is that Sony makes you plug it in to do updates to it, which is kinda cool.  It's also heavier than the DS4, but it feels really good in your hand.  It has a mic built in, so you don't need to wear a headset - and there's a mute button on the controller, which is cool.  Battery life isn't great...maybe with updates to it they can improve on that???????PS4 games!!!!  So, you really don't need a PS4, but you can do remote play with it, so move it to another room!!  Plug in your PS4 HD into the PS5 and everything will load - but I find not as fast as the PS5 games.  Maybe because its loading from an external HD, not an internal SSD.  But, after playing COD on PS5, going into Warzone is a bit of a letdown without the haptics and triggers reacting.  So, while the PS4 games play just fine, the load slower and are disappointing now that I've played the PS5 version of Black Ops.Black Ops - I did order this from Amazon.  It is NOT worth $70.  But, it's one of the best looking games I've ever played.  And I haven't gotten a 4K TV yet - that's what Santa is bringing, so I have to wait.  So, it looks amazing in 1080p, it'll look extraordinary in 4K.  MP is meh...only like 8 maps, 3 or 4 of which were in the Beta/Alpha.  I haven't played Zombies yet.  But Campaign on this game is good - I'm just a mission in.  So much to explore, download, set up, etc on the console, I've spent more time doing that than playing games - so far.PS+ games - you get a bunch of free PS4 games, so you get a solid library of games, but they're not PS5 games, so the controller is feedback doesn't happen, so they're a little disappointing.  The issue is that you only have 825GB of storage space and with the OS on it, you really have like 675GB for games and apps.  So, you can't fit a ton of games on the PS5 overall.  But, like I said, if you have a decent connection, it's not a big deal - delete/download/play/delete, repeat.  I mean, for me, the downloads are so freaking fast, I don't think it's that big of a deal.  Plus I don't have a cap on my internet plan.  I like getting the disks...but probably could have gotten the digital version.So far, there's really only one thing I don't like.  On PS4, you pressed and held the PS button and you could turn it off from there.  Pretty easy.  Now, you have to hit the PS button, scroll all the way over, hit power and then hit rest or power down.  It's maybe an extra button or two, but still.  The UI overall isn't too dissimilar from PS4, but you have to hit the PS button to pull up the home screen options vs double tapping it like you do in PS4, which I think is faster.  I'm nitpicking, really.  It's fine - and it's quick.  I also don't like the USB ports on the front - I wish they were all on the back - it's kinda ugly with wires sticking out of the front. There are 2 USB ports on the back and just 1 on the front.  I think its a USB-C port on the front - maybe for a external HD??  Wish it was just a normal USB port, but at least this unit has more than the 2 that PS4 had - 1 to charge the controller, 1 for your headset and 1 for your external hard drive.  That's an improvement over the PS4 for sure.PS Store - it's now an app on it's own.  It's very quick - no load time to get into it, whatsoever, like we saw on PS4.Be patient...I'm sure Sony is doing what they can to pump these things out to everyone stuck in lockdowns.  I got super lucky I got one - I'm the only one of my close friends and family that has one.  When you do get one, it'll be worth it.  Stupid BOTS are snatching them up and stores aren't carrying them.  Good luck.  It's a solid purchase - a lot of hardware for $500 or $400 if you get the digital version."
2422,Kurtis Pemberton,2020,5,Beautiful system!Fits in perfect and is anchored with an attachable base.The adaptive controllers with motion sensory takes gameplay to an entirely different level.I suggest playing the Astro game that comes with the system.  It will allow you to get a great feel for all of the features of both the system and controller.PS5 you rock!
2423,Simp,2020,5,5 stars for 5 ps5 units thank you amazon and sony making this super easy and painless. I have a unit for each room and the bathroom!
2424,Breanna,2020,1,Go play the console stop being such a bottom feeder
2425,Cindy ,2020,5,Amazing -
2426,Henry Mallory Jr.,2020,5,Amazing
2427,Dennis Ryner,2020,5,I love the playstation 5 so far and I can't wait for more games to come out for it :)
2428,Eid Alotaibi,2020,1,"The worst lunch out in history ever!!! How come one of the biggest manufacturers in the world cannot supply their consumers. If there is a shortage of production, why Sony doesn’t take action on resellers who buy many consoles (where they say one console for each household) and resellers sell them 4 times their prices.If you do it for marketing then Sony, you are a joke!!!!!!TAKE LEGAL ACTIONS and protect your consumers!!!"
2429,the ghost,2020,1,Trash ..to big to fit anywhere price at 499 same as xbox series x doesn't make sense its far inferior then the xbox series x should have been price at 399 can't upgrade the sdd card really...and the controller a gimmick...
2430,Nathaniel Conn,2020,5,This console is amazing. The DualSense controller adds a whole sense of touch to gaming. Astro’s playroom is very original. It plays all of my PS4 games. I highly recommend the PS5.
2431,Jose ,2020,5,11/10 incredible start to the next generation.
2432,Samuel Clemens,2020,4,"I'm going to summarize all the good then get to the bad (growing pains).THE GOOD:Improved UI and User Settings -I'm shocked how much thought was put into the user experience. There are global settings for compatible games ranging from default difficulty settings in your games (easy, normal, hard), adjusting surround sound (or 3D) audio for your ears specifically, preferencing either higher-resolution or faster frame-rate modes alongside everything you could change from the PS4's settings menus (turning off menu music, controlling sleep modes, dimming the controller's lights, etc.). I'm assuming user settings may get more granular over time, but I'm impressed at launch.Much Faster Load Times -You may have seen it from various PS5 previews, but the load times for most games I'm playing are easily under a minute. I'm not noticing any load screens, making play sessions much more cohesive and convenient. Is it the most incredible thing? I'm older now and used to loading screens, so not for me, but assuming most people will gladly welcome this feature.Boosted PS4 Game Performance -This is so so for me. Unless you can measure resolutions and frame rates with just your eyes, you may not notice which games and how much your PS5 is improving your backward-compatible PS4 games. Some PS4 games are getting nearly twice the frame rate boost, but it varies so much from game to game that you have to research each title you're playing to figure out how your PS5 may or may not be boosting its performance.Crazy Good PlayStation Plus Value -I have friends who still don't subscribe to PlayStation Plus, and if they get a PS5, it will baffle me if they didn't get a Plus subscription. If you get PlayStation Plus on the PS5, you'll get a list of PS4 games included. It's a relatively long list, and no, they're not throw-away PS4 titles. Going through the list, I've played most of those games and can tell you that they are some of the best videogames (not just PS4 games) I have ever played. If you've never played Bloodborne, and have a PS5, start playing it now.Those Graphics! -Watch trailers for these games: Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Demon's Souls for PS5, Final Fantasy XVI, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Spiderman: Miles Morales. We don't have a trailer for God of War: Ragnarök yet, but that game is coming in 2021. Those games are either timed exclusives or just exclusive for the PS5. Demon's Souls and Miles Morales are the only games out right now. I'm playing Demon's Souls, and it's the best-looking game I've ever played. Also, because the PS5 is HDMI 2.1 compliant, it should run some games at 4K 60 FPS or 1080p 120 FPS or something in-between. There isn't support for a native 1440p resolution (which is dumb), but I'm assuming that's coming later.THE BAD:Availability -You can't buy it right now. This is obvious and an issue that all companies and genuine consumers are dealing with this year. Online scalpers, limited availability, and the need to have something to do while stuck indoors is destroying available stock. I want to blame Sony (and should), but many popular product launches have been nearly impossible to obtain this year.The Console's Size -The PS5 is offensively huge, and you, for some reason, are required to use the included stand for both horizontal and vertical orientations. Between the console, it's included stand, the PS5 Dual sense charger, and the PS5 dual sense controller - all these devices barely fit into my setup. I'm squeezing them in.Confusing Backwards Compatibility -Yes, the PS5 plays PS4 physical and digital games, but there are three variations. There are PS4 games you play on your PS5, PS4 games enhanced through PS5 updates and/or boosted performance, and PS5 versions of PS4 games you've previously purchased...what? You can't store PS5 games on any external drives (SSD, NVME, or HDD), so that makes me wonder if I can play the PS5 version of PS4 games on an external drive. You can play regular PS4 games and PS4 games boosted by the PS5 on an external drive. That's about as much sense as I can make of this.Small Storage and No Options for Internal Storage Expansion -The PS5 has 667 GBs of usable storage straight out of the box. That sounds like a lot until you start downloading PS5 games and realize you can download about 5-6 digital PS5 games before maxing out. The launch does seem a little rushed since you're also unable to expand that internal storage and, as mentioned previously, can only store PS4 games on an external drive. There will need to be a future firmware update on the PS5 and upcoming 1st and 3rd party compatible NVME internal storage drives before that 667 GBs of storage can be expanded.Conclusion:I haven't had any issues with my PS5. Buying it was unnecessarily stressful, but beyond that, it's been a relatively smooth experience. I've seen horror stories on social media and through the news but haven't experienced any problems others seem to be having. I don’t regret purchasing a PS5, especially with all the exclusive PS5 titles I'm looking forward to. But please don't buy a PS5 off online scalpers; it's not worth the prices they're posting on those websites.Thanks for reading.-SC"
2433,Logan,2020,5,Best gaming console out there but far! I feel bad for the people who can’t get one there’re  really missing out
2434,Richie Pheang,2020,5,Very Satisfied 👍🏻Came In Early & Safe! THANK YOU!
2435,Juana S.,2020,1,How can you like something that you can't have
2436,Sami ,2020,5,Love the console it’s a perfect purchase for those who are looking for an upgrade. Currently it is difficult to get a preorder or purchase online but eventually the supplies will meet the demand. Stay positive folks. A lot of my friends are looking forward to purchase it also. The interface is simple to use and I transferred all my PS4 data by using an Ethernet port tool my like 10 minutes. I also use a extended hard drive too for the console in expanding storage.
2437,Kevin,2020,1,System crashes all the dam time
2438,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Love it. Been working perfectly. Amazon came through with that launch pre order!
2439,H. Jack,2020,5,"While I do agree that the console itself may be a bit on the large size, using it has been a great pleasure. Impressed with the speed, navigating the menu was pretty easy, the controller is amazing with its new features. Haptic Feedback honestly changes the game depending on the title and support. Only concern will be storage space, it will get filled up fast as games slowly release. I can understand the SSD is new gen tech but it will need to resolved fast. Overall the console is a joy and no problems with heating up."
2440,Noah D.,2020,5,"I'm going to keep this relatively short, but I'll start by saying I'm new to the PlayStation family. I've been an Xbox user for the better part of the last decade, and a Nintendo fan for as long as I can remember, but it wasn't until late 2018 that the PS4 started to pull me in. I decided to hold out for the PS5 and I don't regret it at all.The console is slightly larger than I'd anticipated, but that's a non-issue. I know the design isn't for everyone, but I think it looks stunning. I'm a huge fan of the DualSense controller, and Astro's Playroom is a really great showcase for all of the controller features. It's fast, it's quiet, and Spiderman Miles Morales plays beautifully (RAY TRACING!). 10/10 would recommend."
2441,HFK ,2020,1,"Why does Sony choose to support scalpers and not fans? Fans just want to get their hands on it to play and enjoy it. We all know they create fake shortages to cause mass hysteria. Forget that, I've supported Sony games for a long time and won't participate in it this time around."
2442,Adriana,2020,5,"The system is huge, compared to the PS4. The visual graphics are live like, well worth the time we spent online trying to order one!"
2443,Domer Bzomer,2020,4,I honestly can't believe that it can't play 3D movies. Even the PS3 could do that. Just..why?!?
2444,Amazon Custy,2020,1,Sony needs to do better because this is pathetic
2445,E. Seekford,2020,4,"Overall I am happy with my purchase of the Playstation 5, but there are some problems with the console. The console is fast and responsive and most things work fine. However, the new UI is not nearly as good as the PS4 and many things need to be updated soon. It is more difficult to navigate the menus and find exactly what you want. I hate not having a long press on the PS5 logo on the controller like the PS4 had before. I do not like that they have trophies further hidden in the system which makes it harder to get to them. The SSD is super fast, but there is nowhere near enough storage and there is currently no way to expand that storage. The built in Astro's Playroom game is very fun and is a great way to show off the system and controller. Again, I am happy with the purchase but Sony has a lot of things to fix over the next 6 months to a year to make it a better experience."
2446,Ashlee Collins,2020,1,"I beg you, do NOT buy these PS5's for the steep price of $1500 and up.  You are promoting the problem!  I agree with those who say that Playstation handled this poorly (because it's true!)...but if everyone continues to buy the marked up consoles, the bots win and will continue to buy up all available stock as soon as it hits the sites.  Just sit back, and wait.  Keep trying to buy consoles for the regular price.  Lets force these companies to figure out a better way to sell these products.  Make them work for your hard-earned money!"
2447,Amazon Customer,2020,5,The PS5 is amazing. Incredibly fast loading and 4K 60fps gaming are finally here and it’s glorious. Definitely the console to buy!
2448,Simon,2020,5,"Fantastic console, the new controller is very comfortable which old PS pads definitely struggled with and the launch line up is top notch.Amazon delivery on launch day made it super easy and despite all the complaining it was incredibly easy to preorder on here."
2449,Darth Daddy,2020,5,"Was one of the lucky ones and scored one on preorder night!  Love the system so far. New controller is awesome and possibly one of the best PS controllers to date. Only complaint is the disk drive tends to be loud, nothing crazy, but louder than I expected."
2450,Brian K Alesna,2020,1,Taking advantage of the price. There are people out there not able to buy a console because people took advantage of buying multiple consoles to raise the price. Don't buy.
2451,Stacey Nave,2020,1,This is absolutely disgusting to do to people in the middle of a pandemic. My 2 young boys have been dreaming of getting a ps5 from Santa and there is no way for that to happen with people in the world that do this.
2452,Cory,2020,1,"Don’t support those who buy out new items to flip for three times more. You might not get the PS5 by the holidays, but PlayStation will keep making them and you’ll be able to get one later. Yes PlayStation did not launch enough, but it is what it is. The more you support the flipping of launches the more it’s done. Just chill and wait."
2453,Al,2020,5,"Got the Xbox and PS5 and the PS5 is really next-gen. Seems like you are playing something brand new. Highly recommend if you can get your hands on it!(PS: Don't buy from scalpers. Don't pay over $600 for it, no matter how bad you want it. Nothing is worth over 100% upcharge on it. Be patient and you can stop these scummy scalpers from gaining a profit)"
2454,G. Knowles,2020,1,"The bot/scalper issue really isn't Sony's fault. This is one of FTC's methods to boost the economy. Retail spending is the largest sector of the economy. This is just a way to get more money flowing for the purchase of the same product, e.g. $400+$1200 is a bigger impact to the economy than $400. They could regulate it, but why would they?"
2455,Adrian Munoz1,2020,1,"Cool, there’s PS5s for sale now, except they cost $1.700.... why is this allowed?"
2456,Amazon Customer,2020,1,The system itself is 500$ plus tax...so why the blue hell is someone gonna pay over 1000$ for it...I hope no one buys it and you go broke
2457,Nabihan,2020,5,The new dualsense controller is the epitome of next gen.
2458,Badhabitsz,2020,5,Love my system so far so good no problems just lots of fun with my kids
2459,Jeff,2020,5,I’m guessing I’m one of the lucky ones.This system in one word is WOW!My brother has the Xbox series S and for a moment I was liking the Xbox until I set this baby up and got it running and did the update.PS5 is the real deal.
2460,SniperAcademy,2020,3,"This review is just so that others see what’s happening behind the curtain. Sony is smart. They’re artificially creating FOMO so that when they actually release the withheld consoles in some warehouse or whatever, they will have a landslide of cashflow.I know, I know. It’s business at the end of the day but ffs don’t start the next gen with this nonsense. Probably would have done it on the PS5 pro cos I wouldn’t really want to get one, and that’s when you create your FOMO to make me get one. Capische?"
2461,Kristine Juntura,2020,5,"5/5. The hype is beyond real. Jeff Bezos, I'll never say a bad thing about you for the rest of my life."
2462,Amazon Customer,2020,1,"See that lovely empty space on top? Thats where a PS5 should be! Sony is an absolute joke! It is apparent they could care less about loyal Playstation supporters. The preorders were straight consumed by scalpers. Now at launch retailers have less than scraps. Then theres playstation direct online. Youd think was the best way to procure a console direct from as Sony? Wrong again!!!! They go online at any random hour of the day with no prewarning. You sit in a que for 45 min only to be greeted with the same OUT OF STOCK messege you started with. I have done this 4 times and counting. Want to reach an actual person at Sony. They make that impossible as they know people are VERY upset about this. So you tell me you produce millions of consoles knowing demand is up in a pandemic, and previous launch shortage failures, and still botch a release? This is so intentional. You want to tell me with todays tech you cant see exactly which people were in your online que failing to get a console and you cant contact them and take the order directly? Sony is messy and sloppy as it gets."
2463,Amazon Customer,2020,1,It’s a shame how a company like Sony can’t manage their product launch. Big disgrace to them to see people selling PS5 for $1350 when it was launch this same week. Shame to Sony.
2464,Verified Purchase,2020,5,"Can’t believe I scored one of these! Tbh, the step up from the PS4 isn’t that insane. Biggest differences are graphics, old times and controller. Very happy I got one but overall nothing to freak out over if you already own a PS4."
2465,Zachary costa,2020,1,I don’t understand why I can’t buy the console considering the hype up of the next gen consoles you would think you made more then 100 but thank you Sony now I can’t even buy my kids a ps5 for Christmas I’m not so happy about this. Kind of straight crap
2466,Joyce,2020,5,"The Ps5 is amazing. This console is truly next-gen. From the moment you open the box to the moment you play your first ps5 game. The experience is breathtaking. From fast load times, 4k resolution, response times, and enhanced ray tracing capabilities, the ps5 is powerful. Not to mention that the fan can only be slightly heard when playing games that require power."
2467,Serena Olali,2020,5,"Came in on delivery day (nov.12). Love it, great console and great games! 👍🏾 Also Astro’s playroom shows just the beginning of potential for this consoles life span! Here we go!"
2468,Amale,2020,5,The packaging was very good. Absolutely love it. Pre order showed up a day late but I've had zero issues with it. The PS5 was worth the wait.
2469,Mr. Serr,2020,5,This console is amazing. Plays my PS4 exclusives flawless and ps5 game are really fun with the new control. I am enjoying this console a lot.
2470,Steven G,2020,4,"The console is well made, and solid but a number of issues that will likely be fixed in later firmware updates make the current product 4 instead of 5 stars. Data transfer issues, external hard drives potentially causing corruption issues, rest mode sometimes causing corruption issues all of which have a tiny chance of bricking your new console are just no good."
2471,Full time mommy ,2020,1,What a joke. Amazon and Sony should be ashamed
2472,Simone,2020,5,Arrived on time. Perfectly packed. Perfectly working. Amazing device.
2473,Christopher Bott,2020,5,Love it!! No issues at all. Great console with a great future ahead of it. Starts within seconds!!!
2474,Derek P,2020,5,If you're lucky enough to purchase one at retail price you will not be disappointed. Demon Aouls and Astros Playroom two of the best release day titles I've ever played. The new dual sense controller with haptic feedback is game changing. Future is bright for Sony Playstation enthusiasts!
2475,Badoobie,2020,4,"Updated 11/19 w/harmony remote details!I was honestly happy just to be able to buy the system at all. So many people have not been able to get one. My first impression was that it's big, but not ridiculously big. It reminds me a bit of my launch PS3. It's a LITTLE bigger but not much. It's significantly larger than my ps4 pro.Anyway, who cares about size! It's fast. The setup was relatively painless and I was able to migrate my data from my ps4 and hook up the external 4tb drive to the ps5. Any games you have discs for won't show as installed (shows as error) even if they were on the external hard drive. Oddly, death stranding downloaded even though I don't own it digitally...I wish that game wasn't awful, I might have played it...but the weird bottled babies and running around like a post apocalyptic FedEx man while attacking monsters with weapons made out of your excrement is just too weird for me.Astro's Playground is fun and really shows off the dual sense controller. I also bought the new spider-man game. It's not as good as the original, and it has crashed 3 times on my system so far with maybe 4-5 hours of gameplay. The first crash required that I physically power down the whole system by holding the power button for like 15 seconds. Then I got all the errors about shutting down incorrectly and needing to repair my external drive etc. Kinda unnerving for a first party title.The system is quiet which I'm thankful for...the ps4 pro sounds like a jet engine when it's under load. It also doesn't remotely go with the asthetic that I have, but that's a first world problem. Speaking of, it also doesn't work with the Logitech Harmony Remotes...I have the ultimate with hub and it just shows up as an uncontrollable device. Hopefully that will be addressed or I'll have to pick up that PDP IR thing for the ps4 that people say works with ps5.Anyway, I'm sure over time the glitches and stuff will be worked out. It's fast and games look good. Maybe because I'm coming from a ps4 pro that upscaled to 4k it doesn't seem like a huge jump in fidelity, but honestly the games don't seem any different to me as a casual gamer. Textures are a little better. Lighting is a little better. But it's not a leap like snes to n64 or even ps1 to ps2. This is more subtle, but the quality of life change with a quieter system and faster load times is welcome.UPDATE: So spider-man crashes A LOT and I've also had a couple issues with the controller not powering on the PS5 without having to manually power the system off with the front button and then try again from the controller. It's pretty obvious we're beta testing this hardware for Sony. It's a little discouraging for $500 but it is what it is.I experimented a bit with my Harmony Remote (hub version) and found that you can pair the PS5 as a PS4 as a stop gap until Logitech officially supports the PS5. So add a device, select PS4, follow the instructions for pairing. It works fine as of 11/19/2020. The shutdown sequence is obviously different now and I'll detail how I got it working below. The way you change the shutdown macro is by going into the harmony app on your phone, go to harmony setup. Then select add or edit devices/activities. Once it's connected to your hub you should be able to go into ""Devices"" and find your PS5 (which will be labeled PS4, but you can change that if you prefer). Then go into power options and keep clicking next until you get to the option with Power On & Power Off. Select Power Off and setup the following:If you prefer Power OFF mode:PS - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondDirectionDown - 0.5 secondsDirectionRight - 2 secondsCross - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondDirectionDown - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondCross - 0 secondsOr if you are comfortable with Rest Mode considering the issues:PS - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondDirectionDown - 0.5 secondsDirectionRight - 2 secondsCross - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondCross - 0 secondsYou will probably also have to go into Power On options (keep in mind Harmony remote won't power on your PS5) and add something to that in order for the app to let you save the power on/off macro settings.  I just added PS button for 0 seconds. It doesn't cause the remote to hang during power on so it's fine.Hopefully this will help someone to not have to go through as much trial and error as I did. Good luck!"
2476,Vinayak,2020,1,Unjustified and Unwarranted....I  would rather wait & buy a PS6 than the PS5
2477,Raymond Rivera,2020,5,I absolutely love the console. It’s sleek and very modern. It is larger than the PS4 so plan accordingly on where your going to put it.  It’s very quiet and the games look amazing. Don’t listen to other reviewers out there who are bashing the console simply because they couldn’t get one. For $500 your getting your monies worth.
2478,Brad Smith,2020,5,"*** Thanks amazon for delivering my preorder on launch day! ****I honestly only made this review because I felt bad the only reviews posted are sadfats complaining about scalpers. Patience kids, you will get one soon as supply catches up.I am primarily a PC gamer, but this console really keeps up with my new 3090 rig. Adding the SSD drive is no joke and this ps5 is really really fast.Demon souls loads in seconds and the UI is a breeze.Only tiny complaint is that my gf thinks its hideous and ugly in my media room entertainment center and I tend to agree.System is quiet and keeps cool. New controller feels less cheap and does have some fun rumble features.If you play PC this is a great product because you know SONY will have all the best first party single player games for the next few years."
2479,Hellbound,2020,5,The next Generation of Gaming has arrived.
2480,Kindle Customer,2020,1,"Sony and the major retailers have very little integrity and may not understand the consumer backlash and brand damage they are doing with botched launches and flat out lying to the consumer.  On top of the horrendous consumer respect, the PS5 is already seeing a list of hardware and software defects and bugs.  The bad corporate policies matched with the poor product quality is not a good sign for business health."
2481,Aide Rodriguez,2020,5,Awesome
2482,Jorge,2020,1,"At this point, it's pretty clear that both Sony and Amazon reward bots and scalpers over true, genuine customers. This situation was entirely foreseeable at launch and yet, there was nothing done or attempted to resolve or mitigate it."
2483,Keegan Cross,2020,5,Talk about lucky.
2484,jeremy hall,2020,1,Who’s d!”$ do I gotta suc@ to get a ps5?
2485,mknight2059,2020,5,"So far an amazing console. SSD and RTX built into a console is very nice. The only downside is the size of the console itself, but it's understandable why it is so big."
2486,Dre M.,2020,1,I hope none of you sell those overpriced PS5 and you stay stuck with them or have to sell them for cheap!
2487,JEAN D.,2020,1,There should be a one per person limit. But I guess as long as Amazon and PlayStation make their money they don’t care.
2488,Mitchell L,2020,5,"If you can find one in stock its well worth getting, picture is amazing when paired with the correct TV, dual sense controller makes it very fun. I love mine!"
2489,Amazon Customer,2020,1,It is messed up that people do this. Hopefully no one falls for this scams.
2490,Donald,2020,5,I love the controller and the new 3D audio. Games looks so good. Especially Spider-Man miles Morales 🔥🔥🔥
2491,Dragvinity,2020,1,"Just great the only time I get to actually add one in my cart and it’s worth 3x the price.Well then I’m done, keep your system and watch Sony lose out on PlayStation store and PlayStation plus subscriptions. I don’t think PlayStation did their math correctly, yes they made their money this year because all ps5 have been sold out to very few and a lot of scalpers but next year there will be a big drop in online player base and subscription. Also thanks Amazon for letting this happen. Just not going to get one and get a PC. DO NOT BUY these ps5 at 3x price. Regardless the ps5 will forever be going to be release for the next 7yrs until ps6 lol. Patient is key on buying a console. There is no good game on ps5 anyways beside if you would like to play these new games you can buy them for your pc right now and runs better looks better."
2492,Gomes,2020,1,Rip off!!!
2493,JC,2020,1,"I ordered this through Amazon on 11/12.  Every game I play gives error code CE-108255-1 and crashes within one minute.It is most likely a hardware failure.  Who knows how many bad systems are being sold?The system does not play games at all.  If I could give zero stars, I would."
2494,James,2020,1,I pre-ordered and the second I got the email I logged into Amzon. Where I learned  I could not buy it.  I mean literally when I got onto the page to purchase and put in my cart by the time I pushed the purchase button and pay for it it was gone. I I'll just wait til after the 1st. I'm not a gamer at all but like to to the campaigns. Or play split screen. WILL NEVER PAY OVER $500 for this item.
2495,NegroISO,2020,4,"As of November 17, 2020 the PS5 Disc edition is nice. It has some cool horsepower behind it making games that were either patched post-launch or pre-launch fun to play again.Days Gone got a 25gb patch to give us 60fps and a bit better textures.Ghosts of Tsushima got a patch to give us full 4K and 60fps.Last of Us II got a patch, hoping for Uncharted series.Over-all I would say PS5 is what PS4 should have been at 1080p.. meaning they should have shot for 1080p/60 vs 4K/30, but that's every console generation, one step behind and 3 more steps behind after that.Just waiting on more titles to get some post-launch patching so I can replay my PS4 library... At this point if you don't have a PS5 and are only wanting one  for new games, might as well wait. All the games out now are cross-generation meaning they probably aren't taking full advantage of either Xbox or PS5 hardware."
2496,TJ,2020,5,"If you’re stuck between an Xbox or PlayStation, I’ll say this. Out of the two, the Series X and PS5, I’ve found the PlayStation to be the most true next gen experience out of the pair. It’s sleek, quick, snappy and clean. Yes, the actual physical  console does take a bit to get used to. It’s known to be a polarizing design, but after a few days it does grow on you. Did for myself anyways. —- Now when it comes to the rest, it does have the killer apps, only playable on PlayStation. From Demon’s Souls, to Spider-Man’s spin off, to Sackboy. All top notch, high quality games. Each of which takes high advantage of the hardware baked into the console. Loading times? Mostly eliminated. You jump right into games without a hefty waiting period. Levels and zones load in seamlessly and in the blink of an eye. Not to mention the new graphical enhancements from the new GPU. These new games truly show off how PS5 only gets better from here on out.Then you have the UI. It’s an innovative advancement of the PS4’s with a few more bells and whistles. It really helps bring home the “this is next gen” feeling. There’s nothing like exploring a new user interface when you get a new console. This is a different approach than Xbox, who kept the UI the same between generations for inter connectivity of the Xbox ecosystem. That makes the jump on the PlayStation UI side feels even bigger. All in good ways.Finally, DualSense. This controller is the secret ingredient to truly deliver each player into the future of gaming. It’s not gimmicky like some Nintendo features, not at all. But instead it feels sophisticated and it’s one of those features you will only hope most developers adopt on the 3rd party side. Time will tell, but we have seen it with the new COD on top of the Sony published titles. So that’s a start!Overall, if you’re interested and if you can manage to get one of these immersive, innovated and generation leaping machines, then do so. You won’t be disappointed. Full 5/5 for me."
2497,Daniel brown,2020,1,"Don't buy it, there scalpers and bots screwing everyone over"
2498,BleeKasHell,2020,1,This is ridiculous. Why wouldn't you want to get this into the hands of the folks with a verified PSN account? You know the people that have supported Sony by not only buying the PS4 but having a plus membership and have spent thousands of dollars in games too!? Sounds like an easy way of taking care of your loyal customers to me! Instead let's sell thousands to bots who have no reason to buy one other than to turn around and sell them @ eye watering amounts! Saw one sell for  $3200.00. F.U Sony! None of you care as long as they are flying off the shelves... not real shelves but virtual. Wait... you don't even need virtual shelves!? More like virtual pallets where you can't even get the virtual shrink rap off before people start fighting to get at them....virtually. Yes I'm a little salty.... F.U. Sony!P.S.- it is nice that plus members get free rush shipping on the new console.... you know..... the one that's impossible to buy!? Lot of good that's doing!
2499,A. Jani,2020,1,This is the biggest con! Scalpers use bots to buy consoles within seconds when they go out for release then charge inflated prices to actual gamers who want to buy it! I hope NO ONE BUYS from scalpers and they are stuck with the consoles now until their is actually decent stock next year... PLEASE DON'T BUY FROM SCALPERS PEOPLE...
2500,Chris&Tasha,2020,5,I could not be anymore excited to have got this console. Literally snagged one in 10 seconds. After trying and trying on walmart. Amazon didn't let me down. Ive read alot about other peoples consoles crashing. Fortunately I have not had this problem (yet). I say yet cause it could happen. LEEETTTTS GOOOOOO!!! :D
2501,Marshall,2020,5,Your hilarious I can't stop laughing
2502,Roland Mayer,2020,5,Incredible. I cannot speak highly enough of the quality and fun. It’s truly an amazing console and an amazing experience. However I urge anyone interested to not pay over retail price.
2503,Tucker smith,2020,5,This counsel is amazing. Everyone on Xbox hating cause don’t did something better. I absolutely love it.
2504,Garrett King,2020,5,Was fortunate to catch the brief window this was on sale by Amazon - and oh man am I loving this thing.
2505,Conrado Bautista,2020,1,"They allowed certain people to buy so many so that they could resell later at 2 times the value.  While, others count buy them.  Just frustrating!  Shame on Sony"
2506,bbffwilttmabuid,2020,5,"Roll out was torture and I feel for those that didn’t get one, but it is an amazing console. Graphics are awesome and processing speed is off the chart.  The new controller is revolutionary. Hopefully Sony can meet the demand."
2507,Will,2020,1,"Its ridiculous that Sony couldn't make enough or plan for the demand when the gaming market is at an all time high. We have been waiting for these consoles for years only to not get notified for preorders, not get notified when in stock or even be given and eta on more systems. I love my PS4, but Im trying to give my money to Amazon or whatever company that can get one. These things are not worth 1200, 1500, or 2500 dollars. Im more or less disgusted by the fact the retailers have let people buy multiple systems at once. Take a not from the gun market limits need to be in place."
2508,Kuro,2020,5,Love the system next gen for the win... It runs everything smooth only downside is storage capacity but meh so far its good
2509,Shawn Tyner,2020,5,"AMAZON!!!! Thank you for allowing me to snag a Playstation5 from you guys!! I was really trying so hard to find one of these gaming consoles. Walmart was a waste of my time trying to get an online order, what a joke! AMAZON notified me like they said that they would when the item came back available and it was put back in my cart for fast purchasing. Thank you again AMAZON!!!!! Playstation5 works great no issues so far. Very happy with my purchase!!!"
2510,nonyourbusiness,2020,1,"After a lengthy troubleshooting session with Playstation tech support, they determined the controller is not operating correctly.  They want me to pay to send it in to be repaired, which will take 3 weeks.  Very unhappy that i cant play my system for 3 weeks. Also unhappy to have a repaired controller, rather than a new working controller.  They also wanted copy of my invoice to prove the controller is within the warranty period.  (hint...every PS5 controller on the planet is currently within the warranty period right now).  So frustrating."
2511,Destiny,2020,5,The Ps5 shipped fast. There was no damage during shipping. The PS5 works great. No issues with the system or disk drive. The remote is flawless. It provides great sound and outstanding mic quality.
2512,Nikk,2020,5,I am gonna start off by saying I was lucky to get a pre order on time and I got this console on the release date so I consider myself pretty lucky. As far as console goes it’s freaking huge almost the size of my pc case in height but I don’t mind at all because this console stays cool and doesn’t make that jet engine sound that PS4 made also the controller is so good this time that for the first time I will say that I prefer this controller over Xbox controller. This controller is that good but I got big hands so maybe that’s why I love it. People with small hands might have different opinion.
2513,Tyler Leiss,2020,5,Amazing.  Delivered on launch day and every bit as awesome as I'd hope.  Controller is truly a lot of tech right in your palms.
2514,Nadine Landrew,2020,5,"Awesome console, the only con is the size. I was shocked at how bulky it was. Other than that, I have enjoyed it and you won’t be disappointed with your purchase."
2515,LJ,2020,4,Don't buy. For 500 dollars i expext it to last more than 5 days. It crashed and won't turn back onUpdate: after update and reset no issues
2516,Imelda Cardinale,2020,5,Literally stop whining ppl just cuz u couldnt get it within the first week boohoo to bad for you its end of the world wow life sucks.
2517,Richard R.,2020,5,everyone chill tf out you'll all get a ps5. you don't need one right this second. if you buy these resold products for $1200 you're just encouraging this kind of exploitative behavior. just wait. just be patient ffs
2518,Alton,2020,5,Fortunate enough to receive it and I love it! The controller is crazy nice too and playing Astros Playroom really shows what the future of console gaming could be. Highly recommend getting one
2519,Phil,2020,1,I have been waiting for a solid 2 weeks checking day in day out for when the PS5 would come out and it did but half of the sites are botted by scalpers who want almost millions just for the frickin controller. Nobody can get a PS5 other than influencers and scalper. Man PC lookin alot better.
2520,Haya,2020,1,"I'm a grandma. I've got 3 boys who worked, hard, even found jobs to buy this PS5. They nursed their PS3 as long as they could then someone upgraded a PS4, and I litterally took it to the shop 3 times. Personally, I dont buy the hype. A huge bunch of BIG MAJOR NAMES that cant keep up with Demands? These 3 boys watched me on Walmart with the button saying ""ADD TO CART"" And it would not go. For 2 hours. Then it finally said sold out.As much money as I spend on Amazon yearly, and everything Microsoft. Sony with their 40 page sign this contract, Crap?I've got 2- 2012 pcs I've nursed and are all updated. I try to teach these boys, who were ABANDONED by their parents 9 years ago, that Education is key!Remember, MONEY BURNS, it's only paper.So all you BIG companies, you broke alot of hearts,  crushed alot of spirits,  in these kids comments!  FIX IT!!sincerely, HAYA"
2521,April,2020,1,"This really sucks, how can you release the console and no one can get it? Sony SUCKS"
2522,Bryan,2020,5,I'm happy I was able me a playstation 5. I was tired of my ps4 and it's jet like fan. There's literally no sound coming from the PS5.
2523,Junniejjang,2020,1,"Sony makes a couple dollars by selling each ps5, internet scalpers and resellers make 10 times or more by stealing ps5 from our hands at the first place and sell back to us.  One good thing is that I don't need to spend money on ps5 exclusive games if they are ever released this or next year."
2524,Aplace1210,2020,5,"Holy crap, all of these clowns complaining about next-gen console inventory, as if this has never happened before, even when there wasn't a global pandemic happening. As if Sony was just like, you know what, screw maximum sales, let's sell a small amount and string most of our customers along until they decide to buy an Xbox or a pc, yeah, that's a super-practical business idea.We get it guys, it's frustrating to not be able to get one when you want it. You're not unraveling a mystery with your long-winded post about how they should've known, they did know. Supply chains are all kinds of screwed up during the pandemic, this is obvious to anyone not REEEING because they might have to wait another month or two. Deal with it, better."
2525,Blake Phillips,2020,5,Title.
2526,Kyle,2020,1,"First to those complaining about the shortages of Systems.......Do you honestly believe they simply couldn't meet demand?Hahaha, why would they bother to fill every order when they could create a variety of accounts and sell 1000's of systems for 2-3 times the retail price.Should I upgrade to the PlayStation 5?There is really no point in upgrading to the PlayStation 5. WHY? Because it is a rip off.You'll never notice a difference in speed or capability,(unless of course you sit there and focus solely on that) I know, I know it has an SSD but guess what you can add an SSD to the PlayStation 4 and if you do that for a fraction of the price guess what its is the same.It has far better graphics right?Sadly not really. It is capable of rendering more shadows and lighting effects but a lot of that is driven by the game design and while its true the PS5 is better equipped to handle the ""better graphics"" lets face it, a whole new system just to say WOW that beam of light looks so cool is pretty sad.Its new controllers helps you feel like your part of the game right?Well since the controller could have been easily upgraded for the PS4 to include the new mechanisms you really can't count that as some sort of benefit especially with a significantly higher price tag for a device that is not more expensive than the original.Ultimately this system is just to get more money out of people for no real gain. Think I'm just spouting non-sense? Well..... a Digital system for $400 and an identical system for $500 just with a disk drive????? Does anyone actually believe the Disk drive cost them anywhere near $100. It is not anything special it is just an optical drive, it probably cost them $5. A big factor is they want people to go digital. Why you ask? Because they can charge the same price and not bother with the costs of a physical copy and there is no re-selling it to someone else which means others will have to buy it if they want it.So Here is the bottom line. I would buy it in a heart beat if it actually did something worth while. For example if it was fully backward compatible, then hell yes I would buy that. That would be a worth while upgrade. But they don't so they can drive their streaming game service. They could easily make the systems fully backwards compatible at little to no extra cost, but why do all that when there are ways to rip people off."
2527,Paulo,2020,1,Why Sony just why Sony unbelievable you don't care about the ture players that's been with you since PS1 all these retailers just don't care unbelievable we understand its all about the money but it seems your on the scalpers side.
2528,nicole s.,2020,5,"Stunning picture, crisp, smooth gameplay. Alsoplays every PS4 I threw at it better than before.DualSense is incredible, game changer."
2529,Kash,2020,5,Perfection
2530,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Because
2531,Marielena Cook,2020,5,Amazing in every way!
2532,Julio,2020,5,"You will undoubtedly have people rate the PS5 low solely because they could not get their hands on one and are angry. That doesn’t take away from the quality of the console itself.The UI is pretty clean, it boots up quickly, and games run smooth on it. The controller is a standard out and offers true improvements and innovations over the last generation which do help immerse you. There are a few quality of life options that are missing, but I would say that is more on the software side rather than the hardware side. The only problem I have with the hardware is that it is huge, making it difficult to find a nice spot for it in your living room set up. Overall, it is a jump ahead of the last generation and worth the money."
2533,William,2020,5,"I gotta say, I wouldn't have got to order a PS5 on release day if it weren't for the snappy notification I got and 1 tap buying of Amazon being so swift. Walmart couldn't handle the traffic, but Amazon took it like a champ... But I digress, I'm here to talk about the PS5.The set up of the stand they give you is a little awkward to figure out, but it was an easy install. Other than that, it's as simple to set up as a PS4 was. Plug in the power and the HDMI cords, start up. It took me about 3 hours to update/transfer my system stuff. My one complaint on the PS5 homescreen stuff is that there currently isn't backgrounds/themes to select through, but whatever game/app/media you're highlighting will mostly be the background... So it's currently not a huge gripe. I'm sure there will be options in a future update.Now, how does it feel and play? For the most part... Good. I recommend the system's playhouse game to get you familiar with the many possible perks of the controller(s). As one big plus is that each controller has a mic right in them. At the moment I only have Bugsnax installed as a PS5 game, so I can't much comment on how their exclusive games are. (Bugsnax ia super childish, so it's not my cup of tea.) But I can confirm there are still are loading screens for PS4 games, but it feels MUCH less laggy with a PS5. I can't guarantee that you won't ever disconnect with it, but it seems to play online smoothly... Except games like EA's Starwars Battlefront 2, that game's still a laggy mess for me.It comes with about 800g memory free space when booted up, but I plugged in my 2T storage data I had for the PS4 and it didn't struggle to recognize what's on it after the data tranfer process. There's also 2 USB ports in thw back, which tells me if I run low on data for my 2T storage I have a second port for double the data right away... I'll look into that later.The only bug I've heard about the system is if you leave it in rest mode it may freeze or something, but Sony is aware of the issue and os already working on fixing it in a future update. So even with the tiny issues I discussed that's probably going to be resolved in future updates, I'm giving the PS5 a 5 star rating. I don't regret owning one. Good work, Sony! And good work Amazon! The delivery went smoothly as well."
2534,nestor cardenas,2020,5,"It’s PlayStation 5, enough said. Next gen, amazing console. Only flaw is it needs more storage."
2535,Joseperez,2020,1,Gotta love those price scalpers they really make it ok for others to buy a ps5 at 900-1800 bucks especially here in amazon
2536,Zagam50,2020,5,Amazing system. So amazing I had to get 6!!!
2537,Regine Desir,2020,5,I was lucky enough to secure one and get my package 1 day early. Download and upload super quick. The graphics are sick! Love it!
2538,Nathan Bertrand,2020,5,"It's funny that all of the negative reviews on Amazon are from people who were not able to get the console on launch day. I understand that frustration, but I would encourage those people to vent these frustrations elsewhere as it's not an accurate depiction of the actual product. Supply chains and production have been seriously impacted this year and while I agree that Sony could have made more effort to dissuade bots and scalpers, it's worth it to just be patient.With that said, this thing is so fast and is overall great! I've only spent a few hours playing the console but it's been amazing so far. I can start it up from a full shut down and be playing Miles Morales within a minute. Literally.The only issue I have is that rest mode isn't working too well on my console. When it's in rest mode it makes a noise and gets a little warm...I don't really know why and maybe an update can fix that, but I'm not sure how that works. This is easily solved by just powering down my console when I'm done with it and it's relatively quiet when I'm actually playing it. With the fast start-up time, this isn't too inconvenient. But worth it to note!"
2539,SKS,2020,5,An amazing console that actually lives up to the hype. How could you even buy an Xbox when this exists.
2540,Mattatoullie,2020,5,"This truly feels like a next gen console. So many improvements in the user experience, controller, load times etc."
2541,Angel N.,2020,5,"The PS5 really is next gen gaming. I somehow got lucky and placed my order in the small window of time that Amazon had them up, received my order on launch day.It stands to say launch consoles have issues so please try not to put your PS5 into rest mode with Spiderman Remastered until they put out a patch.The PS5 itself is massive but setup is just as easy as it's always been. Loading times are ridiculously fast but there's no approved external hard drive so my old games have taken up a lot of space on my disk version.As for the people leaving negative reviews asking Amazon and playstation why they didn't produce or release enough products, Nintendo Switch also ran out. There were shipping restrictions to and from China not only because of politics but also from COVID. They will release copious amounts of them as soon as they have them so just be patient or switch to another platform. The demand is too high for certain products and sometimes supply just cannot catch up."
2542,Mario Sanchez,2020,5,Love it!
2543,Daniel Herrmann,2020,1,I signed up for all the alerts and emails and notifications and didn't get any notifications. Stayed up til 3 am for days on Hope's and rumors of the possibility to secure a unit again with no luck! This has been the most horrible console release in history! I am not paying scalpers 3x or more for a unit that cost $499 no way ever! Sony and Microsoft are seriously hurting their fan base as are the retailers like Amazon and best buy and target and Walmart. Absolutely garbage!!! Normal folks will be lucky to get a unit by summer 2021
2544,Titus,2020,1,I had it in my cart 5 times on launch day. No luck. They also give little to no information about stock and just want you to waste your time staring at a screen and refreshing their website. They were aware of scalpers but barely made any attempts to combat that. It was a brutal free fall all with people who aren't even loyal sony customer selling the PS5 for 3 times the price!
2545,Brendan Bartanen,2020,5,"First, props to Amazon for having a website that allowed me to snag one of these, as opposed to the mess over at Walmart. It arrived at my door in less than 36 hours. The console itself is simply great when paired with a high-quality 4k TV. The increase in visual fidelity is amazing while still running ~60 frames per second and the controller is awesome and immersive with the upgrades to the vibration. Love having the blu-ray player, as well. This is awesome value for $500."
2546,Fatih Yokus,2020,1,they do this on purpose every year and I will definitely not buy this anymore. I boycott Sony and will not use any of its products.
2547,Chrissy,2020,5,I received my ps5 on launch and was able to set everything up flawlessly. I am in love and looking forward to my gaming experience with my next gen console.
2548,Henrryxd,2020,1,"a long wait for hours, days, to achieve nothing at all."
2549,Terill Ford,2020,5,I like that y’all put this up when everyone was rampaging Walmart’s website. Only Amazon and PlayStation direct actually worked out well
2550,Dylan D,2020,5,Couldn't have been happier to receive this over the weekend. System is a beast and looks sleek. It is a little on the bigger side however thats not to big of an issue.
2551,Kara A. Thompson,2020,1,Disappointed in Sony
2552,Mike Capuano,2020,5,"As someone who likes to have the ""New Shiny"" as early as possible, I was very pleased that my PS5 arrived on release day! I have had a blast with it so far! Demon's Souls is a brilliant launch title, recapturing and improving upon the 2009 PS3 title. Miles Morales continues the magic from 2018's Spider-Man, in a shorter, but more focused campaign. But shockingly, the bundled-in Astro's Playroom is probably the most fun I have had with my new console! It oozes fun and charm and is simultaneously a love letter to all thing Playstation and also a thorough showcase of what the DualSense controller is capable of! For me, this purchase hit all the right notes, but I could definitely say that a large portion of gamers can probably wait to get one until there are a few more exlusives!"
2553,Katie,2020,5,Thanks AmazonSuper fast shippingI was able to buy it with ease
2554,IT Developer 2028,2020,5,"Ok right now it's kinda tuff to get one. True. This is the same old game and should never come as a surprise. Every launch happens like this regardless of the platform. [Xbox or PS5].  (A) There's a need (B) The initial supply is limited (C) The resellers come in and make a huge profit outa greed.  Then the balloon bursts after about 6 months to a year after the holidays. Prices stabilize after the initial big wow factor is gone. Buyers after-taste sets in after they realize they paid for two or three consoles for one that was not worth that much. So what of it, heck that'll never change. Be patient and hang on to your money until after the big bad I gotta have it rush and get the console ""at cost [399/499]"". You've waited this long, why not just a little bit further and save yourself grief and a ton of cash that you'd never get back.  The final reality of it is that it will probably be a while regardless until developers learn how to truly harness the power of the PS5. Just look at the UnReal Engine 5 release, using that platform will take a year or two a minimum. So this minor wait won't deter me, but I'm reasonable also with my hard earned money."
2555,Isaiah Medellin,2020,5,"Great well functioning system and have spent over six hours so far playing with the console and overall performance is top notch and quality. So far I've had barely any complaints and cons from it. The controller is amazing and creative with it's functions. I would highly recommend the Astro's Playroom (free game for PS5 owners) to get the functions of the controller.My dislikes for the console is that it is very big and bulky. As a person with not much room for it, had to make some arrangements for the tall or wide (depending on the preference and location) in your home.Aside from it's massive size, the console is an amazing piece of technology and cannot wait to see how far this generation from PlayStation goes."
2556,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Playstation 5 is the best console and I love when their was a back-door to buy one and all the crybaby’s can’t get one lol sucks for you lmao
2557,Paul,2020,5,I am still amazed that I was about to get a PS5 2 days ago. I had lost hope but Amazon pulled through. Another reason I'll keep using Amazon and prime. You have my business forevermore
2558,Cesar Sanchez,2020,5,"To all the people complaining about not getting a console on release date, go pound sand, I didn't get a console and it's not the end of the world! Understand,  Covid 19 ruin many stuff and the release of this console is one of them.  Give it some time, they'll be more available later on, be patient!"
2559,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Where to begin... thats the hardest part. Sony knocked it out the part this time. From the design to the performance. The feeling you get quickly shifting through menus seamlessly makes your ps4 feel so ancient haha. Its perfect in all aspects.The UI, SSD, 3D Audio, graphics, performance, features and the controller.... so much to say about the controller. Adaptive triggers can fight back or have tension depending on what the situation is. Call of duty shows it by feeling like your pulling the trigger, and feeling recoil. Astros playroom is another story. Boxed in free with every ps5. It will make you smile like a little kid! The feeling from the haptic feedback and the sounds to go with will make for an enjoyable experience.Luckily I was able to purchase one. Seeing a link as soon it was posted that night seconds after is what got me in. Wishing everyone can get one but they are going like hot cakes!"
2560,Ike,2020,5,I received my ps5 on the 14th and was super excited to get started with it. After my unboxing and setting up the stand it was time to get my ps5 journey started. I did all the initial set up and went to the last screen where it asked me do I want to transfer all my ps4 stuff over. I click yes. This was a big mistake on my hand as I didn’t realize it was going to take that long. It was literally like 10 minutes before it said 1% I was being a little patient as I wanted to see what would happen. After about an hour it was 31% and I was getting restless. After some thorough research (Reddit) I found out there is an way easier way to get my ps4 stuff without that long wait using the cloud. So to cancel that transfer I had to shut down my ps4 and enter safety mode? I think it was called and rebuild database. Ps5 automatically restarts and you should be good to go. After that there was no more worries everything worked perfectly and I’m now enjoying the next gen console. Hopefully you all will get to enjoy soon.
2561,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Huge upgrade coming from the PS4. Other than the very large size, everything about this is amazing."
2562,Gfx Designer/Gamer,2020,5,"I was lucky and blessed enough to order one, and amazon delivered it within 2 days through USPS. Thank you, hope everyone eventually can get one and enjoy at some point soon. It's a lovely system, and USPS delivered it with care. Much Love"
2563,miltonbanks,2020,1,Whats really sucks is there was literally a limited amount of product to pre-order so practically on 30 percent of gamers got the product and the rest of us have to wait till it officially comes out instead of this pre-order crap whens there's more systems available that you don't have to pre-order Sony screwed up big time
2564,Review Bits,2020,4,"EDIT:  (8 Month Update)Still maintain earlier points and now that there are more games on the way, this next gen experience is finally beginning to transpire. The console is still excellent and the features haven't lost their luster since launch. Only problem is that a few things have started to impact the experience...Unfortunately I've encountered a few issues that have been slightly frustrating so I'm docking a point. The storage space situation is still frustrating and m.2 support has seemingly been delayed until who knows when. For the time being: if it's a PS4 game, use an external, if it's a PS5 game, pray you aren't playing too many PS5 games.A HUGE issue that occurred was that my data was corrupted and I had to reset my PS5 entirely and re-download my data from Cloud storage. I barely did anything other than attempt to provision an external drive for PS4 game storage which... seems like pretty basic functionality... Luckily all of my data was available from the cloud except for my significant others' offline profile and her data. She felt it was time to change her profile pic anyways o_-----------------------Original:So far there's been quite a bit to love about this console with a few small drawbacks. The experience we've had with this console has felt fully next gen and that's coming from a multi-platform gamer with a fully upgraded PC. This review is broken up into the following sections:CONSOLE DESIGN---------------------The internet was filled with an ocean of memes after the final unveiling of the PS5's design. Seto Kaiba and Doug Dimmadome was two of the most apt and hilarious, and the consensus was that this console looked pretty peculiar. Different from the norm for sure. I'll admit that I scratched my head for a good while as I have with a lot of the other modern, bombastic, and overly complicated modern designs that tend be more present in newer gen cars.Sometimes they take a while to look at and get used to before you see what the artist was going for, other times (like with the new Nissan Maxima) you still cringe every time you pass by it on the road and wonder what they were thinking. Sony was venturing into that same design territory which definitely isn’t typical for consoles. Luckily I’ve grown to love it after having it in my living room for a few days and mounting it sideways. It almost feels like a sculpture or a super-modern accent to your entertainment center.Cooling is another piece of why the console was designed the way it was. The cooling in it seems to work extremely well but it still falls prey to the same issues the PS4 pro did when it comes to keeping it in enclosed areas, though not to the same extent. As consoles tend to become more powerful and the design tends to lean closer PC’s, ventilation and airflow will continue to be an issue unless alternatives are pursued.Overall the design is risky and ambitious, yet not without purpose, and works well. It makes the console almost feel like a piece of modern artwork in your living room. Very cool.HARDWARE & PERFORMANCE-----------------------------------This console is a beast, and as multi-platform gamer with an overpowered PC, trust that I don’t say that lightly. Every console generation has upgraded processors, GPUs, and storage, but one of the unique aspects of this generation was the introduction of SSDs. The general concepts of SSDs isn’t new to most PC users but what’s different for consoles is that the architecture and having them as a standard form factor on a platform. We haven’t seen their full potential used on PCs yet largely because not everyone has them and even if they do, not everyone installs games on them so developers don’t count on that. On the PS5 we now get to fully feel the power of games utilizing this tech to improve load times and also to expand the concept of game design.Due to improved performance and instant loading of assets, developers no longer have to rely on tricks to hide level loading from the player’s view, and other FOV objects shift instantly with almost no performance issues or lagging. It’s absolutely incredible to experience in action and really helps to make more beautiful, engaging, and next gen experiences that would be incredibly difficult to experience even on PC. The performance on this console is also some of the best value for the price compared to PCs as well and doesn’t seem like it will feel antiquated as fast as consoles normally start to.Also worth mentioning is that the PS5 has the ability to play 4K UltraHD Blu-ray discs which is incredible. In the past several years I've had no desire to fork out money for one since the few 4K blu-ray steelbook movies I've bought have the ability to also be downloaded in 4K UltraHD.CONTROLLER------------------The new dual sense controller is one of the greatest features of this platform. With vastly improved haptic motors, it improves the player’s sense of immersion with the games that they’re playing. Astro’s Playroom does a great job of showcasing the various ways that players will experience it in future games while also serving as a great little game itself. You can feel a variety of textures, toughness on triggers, etc. in a variety of environments and conditions. It’s really cool technology and could even adjust game difficulty or mechanics in a really creative and exciting way. It’s likely the biggest improvement in this technology since rumble packs started being built directly into controllers and it’s one of the standout features of the PS5.The overall design of the controller is mostly the same but also feels different as you begin to increasingly notice the small changes. An immediately noticeable change is to the controller's styling. It's now fitted with a really cool two-tone aesthetic to match the console. The controller is now slightly bigger but feels a lot nicer and full to the grip. You'll also notice that the big blinding LED on the back has been removed and replaced with a sleek LED around the edges of the keyboard button. A nice flourish is the texture to the bottom. If you look closely enough you'll notice that those aren’t tiny dots – they’re tiny, microscopic triangles, O’s, squares, and X’s floating around which is absolutely crazy.UI/OS--------As generations move forward and the UI has become closer to perfection, expect fewer leaps. The UI is mostly the same as with the PS4 but with a few flourishes. The menu bar is a lot easier to access with just a mere tap of the PS button on your controller. The initial loading screen up bootup has some really cool effects, and menus are slightly more organized and easier to navigate. The overall design is a bit cleaner and more refined. Overall a great presentation with not a whole lot to complain about other than the confusing choices they made with the display order of the “Friends” menu. I don’t understand why I have to scroll to the bottom to see friends online. Why.LAUNCH LINEUP----------------------The launch lineup is extremely solid. Demon’s Souls and Spiderman Miles Morales Ultimate Launch edition are two of the best launch titles ever released, and Godfall is another decent exclusive. Additionally available are a few multi-platform staples like NBA 2k21, Madden, and Call of Duty. Overall a great launch line up that will give players plenty to do. There’s also a lot to explore in the PSPlus store, which is great because those titles are available to install and play on PS5 as well. Also included for free is Astro's Playroom which is meant to serve as a tech demo of the console's features but ends up feeling like a solid game and homage to PlayStation history.HARD DRIVE/STORAGE------------Storage space isn’t the greatest. The new SSD’s NVMe drive performance is phenomenal but also makes storage space more expensive. The PS5 has 825GB total with only 667.2GB available for games, which may be unmanageable for anyone moving over from their PS4. Luckily PS4 games can be stored and played via an external hard drive. PS5 games, however, can’t be accessed via external hard drives since their functionality relies on them being accessed through a high speed, NVMe SSD. Thankfully players won’t need to worry about that just yet given the limited number of PS5 titles at launch. Sony’s planning on making hard drive upgrades available through a future update. Those upgrades will need to be Sony certified NVMe solid state drives with 5.5GB/s read speeds or higher. It’s a bittersweet categoryBRANDING/PACKAGING----------------------------This is one area where the PS5 feels slightly uninspired. Sony's slowly been moving further in the clean, futuristic/minimalist style, which previous generations have benefited from. Unfortunately it's starting to feel slightly stale and uninspired. The game cases use the same exact blue cases that PS4 games use and the case art design is almost completely unchanged with the exception of the colors. The console packaging feels really basic and minimalist too to the point where is sits on the edge of feeling like little effort was made, almost like this is yet another console being cranked out of the Sony machine. It's hard to feel like this is a strong suit especially when looking into how much effort Microsoft put into the Xbox Series X's packaging. Luckily the PS5 makes up for this in other areas.BUGS-------There have been a slew of bugs reported by other outlets. For us, the only issue we've experienced was with the initial attempt at transferring the data. The first attempt failed (partially? it wasn't quite clear) but the second attempt at copying data over succeeded. It's unfortunate that PSN accounts are required to transfer users over from PS4 so my girlfriend's local account couldn't be transferred.============BOTTOM LINE-----------------The PS5 has a few small hiccups but is a really outstanding consoles with some really cool features that set it apart from pervious generations and current gen alternatives. As more generations of consoles are released and fewer improvements are left to be made conceptually, it’s slowly becoming difficult for anyone other than Nintendo to avoid feel stale or like another lineup in the large industry machine. Luckily new haptic technology, a bold new design, meaningful use of SSD technology, 3D sound, and cool tweaks to the existing Sony formula help set this console apart and feel even more exciting than the PS4 did initially in some ways. The level of backward compatibility so far is also extremely impressive and being able to play 4K bluray is a nice feature to have. It would’ve been nice to see cool new branding and cool new game cases, but you can’t have it all."
2565,Cynthia,2020,5,"Delivery was smooth, great product, five stars."
2566,Dale Venderez,2020,5,Improvement by leaps and  bounds over the PS4. Would highly suggest getting the disc based version over all digital. It’s also super quiet and the controller is amazing!
2567,Shahzad Soonawalla,2020,2,"Most of the reviews are about the console’s inventory and retail release criticisms. As gamers, we are confident in the PS5’s capabilities. That’s not the issue. The issue is that they are under stocked on the consoles as they are taken by surprise of the high demand that outweighs the supply. I understand that it takes a lot of time and money to mass produce multiple PS5 copies, but why give it out to specific groups if it’s meant to be played by all? Just to be clear: this review is about inventory and retail release issues, not the console itself."
2568,Donnie,2020,4,How it came on arrival ....looks as if someone opened it before me.
2569,MM,2020,5,So I bought this for my husband as a present. He really wanted it and was upset it was sold out everywhere. I ended up getting my hands on it and it’s the best present I ever bought him. I’m not a gamer but he is and says it has great graphics and the remote control is the best part because you feel every thing that happens in the game it feels like your in the game. I recommend this to all gamers!
2570,Gerry Pedraza,2020,4,The only limit is the stock.
2571,Ben,2020,5,Awesome
2572,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"I was projected to get my ps5 at 11pm on launch day, but it showed up 9 hours early. Box was in good condition and I've had no problems so far"
2573,Anferny Wayne,2020,5,"Beautiful System. It’s incredibly responsive and very intuitive. UI is extremely similar to PS4.Please play Astros playroom once you get your PS5. It really shows off how awesome the controllers are.Upgrading to Borderlands 3 for PS5 was easy. Just had to insert my PS4 disc, then it downloaded the remaining content for free.Awesome job Sony!"
2574,Todd,2020,5,"I don't own a Playstation 5, just like all the whiny kids that gave this a one star because they couldn't get one. I guess when you are raised with mommy buying you everything, this is the adult method for throwing a fit. ""I'm mad I didn't get my way, I'm going to give it a one start review"""
2575,Ken,2020,5,Good system and console install cd game fast.
2576,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Next gen controller is a game changer
2577,Tyler,2020,5,Graphics are truly something else 😍
2578,Antretz Mcdowell,2020,5,It a nice console work smoothly apparently no bug the gave it to me a day early and thank once again amazon
2579,David Markley,2020,1,Worst launch ever..thanks for nuttin
2580,.,2020,1,"Wow. Just wow, Sony. You hype up and CONTINUE to hype up a console that admittedly looks amazing, yet most of the population who want one can't even GET one. Let alone multiple. And Amazon, you're just as at fault, with your terrible ""notification"" system that never EVER worked ONCE. God, this is pitiful, but why should the companies care? They get money one way or another so who cares, right?"
2581,LoneWolf22,2020,5,"First, I would like to say that it feels surreal to have been able to purchase a PS5 on launch day. I checked and checked obsessively only to get ""Out of Stock"" at the order review section. Not necessarily Amazon, but other sites. The whole reveal/pre-order was a debacle. Sloppy, sloppy sloppy. Thankfully, Amazon came through with their notification and it went through smoothly. Maybe its because everyone was focused on the Walmart promotion? Either way, glad it was the actual product.In terms of the system itself, it so quiet! I had it on all night (transferring PS4 data). My fan made more noise than this. The unit is HUGE. I had to clear out a section of my setup. My photo isn't doing this justice but if you look closely, the inside has small white playstion controller shape (❌🟦⭕🔺️) details , which is awesome. The controller, WOW. Using it makes you feel like you're in the game. Although, it's only been 24 hours, I've been impressed so far. The only complaint so far is the travesty and headaches of trying to get ahead of the bots...."
2582,E-Man,2020,5,"This review is written from the perspective of a primarily PC gamer. First impression, this console is HUGE. This is bigger than a Micro ATX sized PC. Performance wise, the system is super fast. Games load in mere seconds, something even PC can't do currently (DirectStorage and RTX IO will fix this). Graphics shine on my LG 27GN950-B gaming monitor and HDR really brings games to life. PS Plus also gives access to a bunch of games I missed from the previous generation (didn't play much of the PS4). I'm really excited to see where this system goes and how it will push forward PC gaming."
2583,Isaac,2020,5,Amazing!
2584,Aluah Alishlah,2020,5,"I have no idea how I was able to do it , but like magic there it was...the ""GOLDEN BUTTON'' that said add to cart. I've never purchased an item so fast in my life. And exactly 10min later I get an email from amazon saying the item I viewed was in stock to buy ;but I'd already been refreshing my browser every 10min on every possible website and I couldn't believe it until it showed up yesterday that I gad actually got my husband the only thing he wanted this year. thanks Amazon and all the people who moved a little slower then me🤷‍♀️😜💋❤😘"
2585,Brian Y,2020,5,"Was able to pre-order on the 1st day, was nervous due to all the pre-order issues happening EVERYWHERE, but just like my PS4 ordered from Amazon, the delivery was completed without a hitch. I know people are upset they couldn't get one, but it's not Amazon's fault, and largely not even Sony's fault, they had and sold more pre-order inventory than the PS4, one of the top selling consoles of all time, during a pandemic. Everyone who wants one will eventually get one, no need to review bomb for not getting one at launch.Now for the consoles. It's GREAT. Only a couple minor issues, which are widespread and will be fixed with an update. I'm coming from the OG PS4 so being able to take full advantage of my TV, plus the power of the PS5 has been amazing. The dual sense controller has to be used to truly understand the hype, which it actually exceeded for me. Yes the console is big, but we knew that, and I had adequate space in my entertainment center. I actually love the look of the console. It's got a cool unique look and it's a conversation piece for sure. Now I need to get that charging dock for the dual sense and I'm set."
2586,Amber B,2020,3,"Ok first of all I do want to get a ps5 if we can ever have any availability at some point...am I right?! Lol but is it me or does anyone else think that the ps5 is extremely ugly and the controller looks more like an xbox controller now, which sucks. I've never liked Xbox because of the controller and now ps5 looks like it. It's kind of disappointing, but it's not going to deter me from wanting one haha I just hate that they made it so bulky and the design isn't cool looking. Hopefully everyone who wants one can get it soon, though!"
2587,alyssa,2020,5,Was able to get it when it dropped and it is preforming great! I have no issues with the ps5. It came with all the cords I needed and the cord for the controller.
2588,Sarah,2020,5,"Way very pleased that I happened to refresh the page at one of the exact right times during the 20 second long drops on release day. This console is definitely going to bring a lot of gaming fun into our household! I love the controllers vibration differences and all the little things make it so good. Now, if they'll only talk about that GTA-VI release date...I want to see player induced drive-by shooting in as HD as possible!"
2589,Jamela,2020,2,"You'd think after launch day, it would be available to buy. Just, like...a simple concept, I know...I do plan on purchasing, and I am a fan of Playstation. But if the aim of the scarcity is to increase the demand, that is a crappy game to play against consumers. They already hyped up the scarcity way beforehand, which means they had so much time to ramp up production and fulfill pre-orders, etc. I don't get it."
2590,Clint Brown,2020,5,"To all the people whining that they didn’t get one. Sorry. Anyways this system so far is amazing. I was real worried about the controller feeling too different. But, it has impressed me beyond belief like why haven’t they thought this before kind of deal. The system it’s self is huge so expect to take up a lot of space on your entertain stand. As far the graphics and all that junk it lives up to the hype."
2591,Matthew Rhoads,2020,5,"The Playstation 5 is a blazing fast console with the potential to change the way we as humans game forever. When I first opened the shipping box I was amazed at how massive the Playstation 5 really is. It measures out at almost 16 inches vertically and definitely resembles more of a gaming PC than a console. The set-up of the console itself was relatively easy with both the card UI and using the Playstation App to link my account, the entire process took relatively moments to complete. Once booted up and updated I began to insert my PS5 games, Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Spider-Man Miles Morales. Both games took less than 30 minutes to copy over to the Solid State Drive and started up without any hitches. I began with Spider-Man Miles Morales and was instantly amazed by the graphical capabilities of the PS5, native 4K is already an awe-inspiring experience but it became even more sublime when zipping around New York City on my PS5 looked more like watching a movie than playing a video game. However, not only are the graphical capabilities of the PS5 absolutely astounding but Sony's construction of the Dualsense controller is markedly genius. While playing Spider-Man I could noticeably feel each and every web leaving my hands and the resistance building in the triggers as I soared across the city. Overall, the PS5 is a game-changer, making 4K gaming an absolute blast while maintaining maximum potential for the future of gaming."
2592,JE1992,2020,5,"As someone who has been able to snag multiple consoles for other people on other sources let me say one thing.YOU CANNOT POST A BAD REVIEW FOR A PRODUCT YOU DO NOT HAVE JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD TO GET.Let me remind everyone that the world shutdown this year and that causes major distribution and logistic issues not to mention production. There were millions more consoles available at launch than the PS5. Keep in mind that THE WORLD is still unemployed to an extent. So not only is the demand high but it is higher for that reason as well.Now. Let’s get to it. I’ve gotten the disc and digital version. (Not both for me). This console is unbelievable. It is so quick and vibrant and the controller is unprecedented. This console is worth every penny. I do not get in console wars. I think they are pointless and childish. I have a built a PC. I have had consoles. Consoles are convenience and more entertainment centered. That being said. If you can get your hands on one whether it be for you or for others, don’t hesitate. Worth every penny. Don’t be a scalper. I get making an extra 100 but putting inventory up for 1200 where no one will buy it is a joke."
2593,Dominick Cruz,2020,5,Got it this morning! Can’t wait for what the future of the PS5 holds!
2594,Zack Campbell,2020,5,"The only next-gen console that feels NEXT GEN.- Wildly smooth operating system- Haptic feedback you have to feel to understand- Similarly incredible adaptive triggers- Tempest 3D audio that changes the way I play games- A new and beautiful user interface, the way any new platform should launch- The best selection of launch titles I've seen- A gorgeous and unique designHonestly, I almost always buy consoles and major gaming hardware at launch. I have never been as pleased as I am with PS5.My Xbox Series X feels like a mistake. :/"
2595,Anthony Rubino,2020,5,When I finally was able to purchase it (within 2 seconds of mashing the add to cart button) I was so ecstatic. It arrived yesterday and I will say that it is seriously an amazing console. The new controller really needs to be used to understand why it is amazing. It really makes you feel the action you are doing in a game. The ps5 to me is very sleak and futuristic looking. It is large but not as ridiculous as everyone makes it seem to be. I've had every playstation in my life and I can confidently say this one is easily the best. Don't give up mashing the add to cart button the next time it's in stock. You won't regret it.
2596,Chalee,2020,1,"grats to the ones that were able to preorder, sadly i wasnt one of them. but screw these ppl trying to resell ps5 for1500. sony made psn users do a stupid long survey yet it was all useless."
2597,Justin ,2020,5,Both consoles got in On launch day . one for me and one for my son. Thanks amazon !
2598,Amazon Customer,2020,1,"This is getting ridiculous now. I have been hunting a unit since the pre order days, no luck. Now, in the Middle of a pandemic, I'm making a huge effort to be able to afford the digital edition at least, then Sony and amazon decide to let this happen. Like I'm not even able to purchase those expensive ones because of the items going out of stock 1 Second after they posted. I'm not going to lie, I want the console, but trust me, I'm not putting no more efforts on trying to hold up on the money it seems like they Just dont need my money."
2599,MP,2020,1,"This is one of the worst launch ever I have experienced by the company that is almost synonymous to its gaming console. Its one of the most liked brand for its consoles, not this time around. They didn’t care about their genuine customers, who wanted to get hands on JUST ONE PS5 console for the holiday season."
2600,ShayShay,2020,5,"This game was extremely hard to get, but I luckily got it on release day for my husband he was soooo happy. We had been trying on Walmart all day and I so happened to check Amazon and it was there! He soo excited and loves the game system. The picture is amazing it loads wayy faster then the PS4. One con the game system is huge ! But looks cool"
2601,Amzn Cust,2020,4,"I was so excited to have been able to order one for delivery on release day. System looked and worked beautifully until I got to the Home Screen at which point the GPU started going crazy throwing bad lines of pixels all over the place after about 20 seconds of being on. After over 5 hours of actively trying to call Sony support, I finally got through for them to say the only option to to send it in to their repair center. This involves a 3-5 day delay for them to ship me a box, then 3-5 days back to the service center. Once they receive it, 10-15 days to repair/replace my unit. Lastly, 3-5 days back to me. At this point I’ll be lucky to get one by Christmas. I wish you luck that you don’t end up with a defective unit but my advice would be to wait until the initial batch issues are fixed and/or Sony at least has a better repair process.UPDATE: Yesterday I was notified Sony had sent me a package overnight. When I opened the package today, they sent a letter apologizing and acknowledging how frustrating it must be to get a defective unit. The best part, they sent me a NEW unit in the box with instructions to return my defective one. I can’t say how surprised I was and happy to have a working PS5. Their customer service really came through and I appreciate the effort here. Best of luck to you all finding a unit!"
2602,dan,2020,5,Was so nervous about it arriving on time but it came right to my doorstep woohooo!!
2603,Alpgkatl,2020,5,"Amazing console, Super quiet and overall great design with white plate. It fits perfectly with my TV stand. Next Gen is here guys! Get ready!!!"
2604,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Awesome console! Really is next gen especially the controller. Couldn’t be happier. Luckily I was on my phone when they went in stock, I had signed up for stock notifications and could get on Amazon for the 20 second window to get one!"
2605,Mista 808,2020,1,"I was excited to get my PS5 thinking it would be so much better than the PS4 Pro.At least twice as good right?  WRONG!  It honestly doesn't even seem like it's that muchbetter than the PS4 Pro.  Sure.. it loads a lot faster but if that's the main reason you'rewanting to buy one then feel free.  The controller is also not what I was expecting.The analog sticks feel cheap and the size of the controller is a bit ridiculous.  I can seemaking it a little larger than the PS4 controllers but they made the controllers HUGE!Did I mention there's basically no games out for it yet?  So far I've been only playing myPS4 games like Rocket League and Rainbow 6 on it.  May I add these games are bothwell over half a decade old.  Instead of being mad that you didn't get a PS5 during thelaunch, JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH and be thankful you didn't!  Give it a year or so andthen purchase one.  They'll surely drop down to $299 or at least a bit lower by that timeand at least there will be games available at that time.  With it's current price point of$499.99 (after tax and purchase of ONE controller we're talking $630 dollars.. you mayas well just spend a couple hundred more and get a PC that's twice as good as the PS5and will also open up thousands of games at your fingertips that are already out!Don't bother with the PS5 right now.  It's honestly not worth it.  To be quite honest, I haven'teven bothered playing it much since I got it a few days ago.  I've been playing Modern Warfareon my PC that has 10x better specs than the PS5 will EVER HAVE and my PC is already morethan 2 years old.  FACTS!"
2606,NikoB,2020,1,Sony knew demand was high they do this everytime this ceo needs to get the production team on point this is ridiculous its almost impossible to beat the bots.. there should be 3 to 5 even 10 times made and sent out for everyone they had months to get it right.. they do this everytime like people never learn in life it sucks
2607,Brady Muzzey,2020,5,the next gen is here... truly an amazing console great speed and also great gameplay... good delivery and safe packaging would recommend 10/10
2608,Abraham,2020,5,Way better than the xbox
2609,Jackie Stallard,2020,5,perfection
2610,Sai Huang,2020,5,"Get PS 5 today, and i play Fifa, it was awesome and fast!!"
2611,DJTEL,2020,5,"Let me start off by saying that I love this system! Never have I ever ignored my wife the way I started ignoring her when I plugged this baby up. It has brought peace to my life. She can’t tell me nothing! Plus I purchased it myself so she has no control what so ever. Fellas, do yourself a favor and go get you one! Just think about how much money you’ll save in counseling by just ignoring what triggers your mental health. Life changing, I’m satisfied. Life’s damn good now!"
2612,Cole Banuelos,2020,5,"Very quiet, fast load times, graphics"
2613,Aaron Medina,2020,5,"Its beautiful makes my new 2020 LG look amazing, frame rates are impressive, Raytracing is superb, SSD is blazing fast id compare it to a Lambo"
2614,Konner McIntosh,2020,5,"With that INSANE DualSense controller and the crazy high resolution, it truly is the future of gaming! I LOVE THIS SYSTEM! I’ve had it for about 8 hours now and I’ve played it for every second. The hype and amount of trouble I went through to get it was all worth it! The controller alone could be a selling point, it is so crazy to have the back triggers properly recreate what you are doing in game! Plus, getting my PlayStation 4 games working on it was a breeze! A crazy fast memory transfer by connecting them both to the internet was shocking to me, because I transferred roughly 100ish gigabytes worth of memory in NINETEEN MINUTES. Also I love how there are finally some ports on the back of a PlayStation! It was about time to do that! Sorry if this review is all over the place but I just wanted to let you all know that this truly is an amazing buy. Good luck to everyone trying to get one!"
2615,Brandon Big Soldier,2020,5,I absolutely love this console.
2616,L. TAYLOR,2020,5,The future of gaming is here!
2617,luigithebeast,2020,5,It’s a well made console and lucky enough to get it a few days after launch.
2618,XLLLLLL,2020,5,"Amazingly fast delivery. Kudos to Amazon.Next-gen console feels so smooth, the controller is out of this world. Can't wait to have more PS5 games."
2619,Sean,2020,5,Im literally curious how many were sold from Amazon. It looks like only a 100 to 200 were sold based on comments on launch day. Tbh i dont even know how i got mine on Amazon was a fluke or luck or some random timing.Honestly thought at least amazon wouldve had at least way more than this...
2620,Keith,2020,2,Got the system with no controller
2621,Blake Smith,2020,5,Amazing console. Own a gaming pc switch ps4 pro and xbox one x. The ps5 is easily the best one ive ever played. Great job by sony
2622,Alex Cruz,2020,5,"I love this console, when I got it I was blown away on how fitting the controller was in my hand. The adaptive triggers and haptic feedback bring emersion to console gaming. I love the speed of the loading and downloads. My one downside so far is downloading one game at a time. But other than that, the frame rate up to 120 hz is absolutely amazing. I couldn’t wait to get my hands on the PSV. The frame rate is so smooth now and I never knew how smooth more frames could have. I can’t wait for my friends to get this console! I dislike people review bombing because they couldn’t get their hands on a preorder"
2623,87thhunter,2020,5,"It's a new system, why is it a shock that there sold out. You don't Need a ps5. Wait till the rush is over an buy one.As of now all the games will be for both systems anyways, 1 star review because of limited supply like the last 3 systems they released.....wow what a shock this time, not!!!"
2624,Lonnie J.,2020,1,Disappointed. Been trying for days to buy this console and I’m sick of trying. At this point I give up. I’ve tried every single place they are offered. The second they go on sale websites crash and freeze and you can’t actually buy them. Terrible release and I’m disappointed I’ve spent days screwing around with this without every even being able to order one.
2625,Aucifer,2020,5,been a few hours into testing and i have zero complaints. will be purchasing 2 more when available . purchase COD with it.
2626,Stacy jones,2020,5,"Bought it on release day it came Saturday afternoon, my boyfriend loves it and I was lucky to have found it when I did! Money well spent!"
2627,Rob Clark,2020,5,"For those that are wondering why there aren’t more PlayStations it is because they do it on purpose. There is no way they can test for all the possible glitches that the console may have so they use the first batch as a sort of beta for the remaining PlayStation’s. Once they are sure they fixed all the reported errors, they will ramp up production."
2628,Angel,2020,1,BS Sony releasing this in such limited supply making it unnecessary difficult and time wasting to Try and buy.  Boycott PS5
2629,Don,2020,5,The console has been the thing i have been waiting for for so long and its worth it
2630,Ridge Tawdrous,2020,3,"Off the bat, the box is HUGE and heavy, not a great thing for a console, might as well get a PC. Secondly, I had a HORRIBLE experience with Amazon. Delayed shipping twice and the customer service manager did not even know why or when my shipment will be shipped or why it was delayed. Otherwise, I love the PS5 and it’s super high graphics is a really nice upgrade from the PS4 and the controller is sheesh amazing!!"
2631,Francisco,2020,5,Amazing gaming experience
2632,Kevin,2020,5,The ps5 is so dope bruh
2633,NuggetsRams370,2020,5,Lovely
2634,Miguel Reyes,2020,5,so far the best video game console
2635,J. Mulkey,2020,1,"Forget it, I'll just drop some money into my PC. Sony knew this would happen and still let it."
2636,M. S.,2020,5,You already know what you are looking at. Get a ps5 or you'll regret it. Doesn't smoke like an Xbox. Haven't stopped playing.
2637,Irby,2020,5,5 stars
2638,Mike,2020,5,"This is an actual review of the system, not a salty review of someone who missed out for the 10th time. There's other forums for that, but I'll spare you for now.I'm a casual gamer, and play when I can. PS4 was a great system, but PS5 takes it to the next level. The graphics are most noticable when you get to gameplay, as many of these games you can't tell the characters are actually fake and not actual humans. Sound is rich and navigating around is smooth. The console itself is HUGE.The selling point is the controller. The adaptive feedback is legit, and takes gaming to the next level. Astros playroom must be played to get the full effect of it.One thing that sucks is the storage. GET AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE. YOU WILL NEED IT."
2639,Troy,2020,2,"What I dislike about it? Well launching a console without the numbers to support public demand. Maybe launching in 2021 giving yourself TIME to manufacture, and telling the public and NOT giving the stores the right to OVERRIDE sales dates. Also, everyone knows about it, so giving sales to Streamers or Celebreties is a dick move. Alienation if the player base if you will."
2640,ddavis,2020,1,"I know this make me sound ticked off... And well.. I am. I did everything I was supposed to do... Signed up for notifications from here on Amazon... None came.. When I called customer service as to why my notifications never came through the explanation was a a ""glitch"" in the system.Due to health reasons... This could well be my last Christmas with my son who is 14... I cannot afford the ridiculous amounts the resellers are asking... I had planned on using my Amazon rewards dollars to purchase this.. Apparently that isn't going to happen. The way this entire roll out has been handled by the largest media company in the world and the largest retailer in the world is a travesty. This is personal and yes.. It hurts.Shame on me for assuming it would be handled in an orderly manner. Selling prior to the release time.. Then no e available when it comes as supposed to be... Even the playstation direct site only says check back tomorrow for additional units... That didn't happen either and it's not like I can be held hostage staring at my phone or a computer screen for hours. I got into the que on the 13th and when I was down to a 2 minute wait Sony logged me out and back to an hour wait which by then of course it was sold out again. They said more units to drop on the 14th... Didn't happen.Great loyalty to long time users while resellers are now charging well over 1k per unit."
2641,Joey,2020,5,"I was on Instagram around 6PM on 11/12 and Amazon sent me a notification that PS5 was in stock so I clicked the link and bought one! Less than 12 hours later it arrived and I didn’t even plan to buy one until 2021! The system itself is amazing, quiet & very fast! The Controllers are the best part. It has a nice weight and feel with a very long battery life, six plus hours for me in one sitting. Load times are almost non existent now as well. The small quality of life upgrades are well worth. Aesthetics in my opinion is very modern and futuristic. I can’t complain I just wanted more launch games. I’m so glad I bought one!"
2642,Joe,2020,5,"The PS5 is just an excellent machine, futuristic design, incredible controller, the brand new UI and best of all its amazing catalog of exclusive games.No wonder the PlayStation brand is the most successful home console brand ever.Highly recommended!"
2643,J Hack,2020,5,Absolutely amazing. Simple as that. Best gaming console of all time.
2644,MP64,2020,5,"Thank you Amazon for not crashing while I'm trying to buy a PS5. Console is awesome, but needs more storage."
2645,angel eduardo,2020,5,"All these cry babies run to mommy, broke little kids are the only mad ones. Now is the time i copped im enjoying it and am selling extra for resell making $$$ , always after the bag. I like exclusity not something everyone can have. I feel superior . now if u want one you have to pay to play.YEAA"
2646,Amazon Customer,2020,1,Taking advantage of high demand
2647,John,2020,4,It wasn't ready to be launch
2648,deatharis,2020,5,"Thank you amazon for not giving up on getting this to me amazing early Xmas gift delivered at 8pm but your driver was amazing not to give up, and get it to me thank you.As for the amazing PS5 wow Night, and day with everything to graphics, speed, look, and wow most silent fan under heavy load for a console 😀 good bye jet engine ps4 pro lmao"
2649,Dragnoria,2020,5,"Absolutely Amazing.The controller feels amazing, the console is completely silent making absolutely no noise whatsoever, it looks great the menus is a great redesign from the last generation and overall this was definitely worth the wait."
2650,Seiya Soiya,2020,5,"It's quiet, quick, and will have a lot of exclusive games in the future. Would recommend for all gamers."
2651,rainman,2020,5,Best console ever. All u babys that are saying why no preorder well yeah. Happens every console launch get over it. And with covid this year it's even worse. Not selling mine and I love it.
2652,Darren,2020,1,Just release the product randomly so everyone could have a shot. I wasting to buy one for my son. He can wait though before i give somebody on FB marketplace or offer 1200. The one star is not against amazon or the product. The rating is solely for the way the release went down.
2653,Anony Mous,2020,5,"I was lucky enough to get this when it went on sale release day. I have been playing a couple games so far and everything has been running excellent. If you didn't get one, don't give up or pay an extreme price! There will be plenty more released before the end of the year. Have fun and game on!"
2654,Byron,2020,5,"I had the PS4 slim and it is major upgrade, faster loading, higher resolution, backwards compatibility with PS4, awesome controller. The system itself is really big however but so far that’s the only thing that rubs me the wrong way a little bit."
2655,Amir,2020,5,..... It was in the cart!!!I need one!
2656,Casey,2020,5,"Games Play great, look great, a true next gen experience."
2657,James,2020,4,"Every thing worked fine out of the box, they're is some issues with backwards compatible games. Modern Warfare aearzone has some issues.The console is a monstrosity. And the console is horizontal orientation is a bit awkward looking.The controller is much more comfortable for big hands guys."
2658,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
2659,Brandi,2020,5,"I signed up for in stock notices of the ps5 when pre-sales first came out and didn’t think there would be a chance in getting one from Amazon because of limited stock. Two days ago, I got a pop up notice saying there was stock, immediately clicked it, added to my cart and checked out. Then I second guessed and wondered if I’d been swindled but two days later, it showed up!! My son is beyond excited! So glad there’s Amazon because WalMart has been a joke with their timeouts and website crashes."
2660,Harshdeep Kahlon,2020,4,"The controller is really innovative and game changing in supported games. The trigger can adjust resistance, the haptic feedback is awesome, and the built-in mic can be pretty useful.However, when you see developers on the Xbox Series X/S easily scaling their Xbox One games to 120 FPS and better quality graphics without much effort, you might wonder why they’re not doing the same thing for PS4 games on PS5. Sony does not let PS4 games utilize PS5 features without a native next-gen version. For example, Rocket League can be played at 120Hz even on the Series S, while the PS5 is stuck at PS4 Pro settings until a native next-gen version is released."
2661,Tyler Farrell,2020,5,Long-time PlayStation gamer. Love the new console. The Dualsense 5 is perhaps the best upgrade from the last generation of gaming.
2662,Daanish Fiaz,2020,1,"Purchased ps5, played 1.5 hours, console shuts off on me randomly and now won't turn on. Contacted both Sony and amazon and neither one is able to provide me with a replacement yet. Extremely disappointed and saddened by what has happened to my system. Absolutely dreadful experience."
2663,Xavier,2020,5,"Alright let me start off by saying that I’m probably not the only one who’s this excited about the PlayStation 5. And I’m sure a lot of you are anxious to own this bad boy and I gotta say once you get it, it’ll be worth the wait I promise you. I’m just so happy to finally get rid of my PlayStation 4 because im sure that a lot of you know how loud that thing was. But the PS5 is nothing like that. the most quietest console I’ve ever owned!!! The best part about owning this system is that, you don’t really need your PlayStation 4 because the ps4 is literally integrated into the PlayStation 5. You can download all your digital games for ps4 it’s literally right there in your library next to all your ps5 games you’ve purchased.The PlayStation Store:it is so much easier to get to and it’s much much much faster!!! you literally do not even have to load up the app anymore it’s all right there. There’s no need for loading screens. And I hated the PlayStation 4’s store it was super buggy and I did not like how it loaded sometimes because I’d have to restart the whole ps4 because of how slow it was and because it froze on me a lot.Your Library: as I’ve mentioned before all your games you’ve purchased on the PlayStation 4 it’s right there it is so easy to find and easier to download everything. I have not run into any issues and all my games are literally there ready for me to download and that’s exactly what I was hoping for and my dream came true!The Load Times:Ok we ARE LITERALLY IN THE FUTURE! My young self would’ve appreciated this very much! We’ve all been waiting for something like this for the longest time! And it is finally here. Who wants to sit and wait to game ? not me! As I’m sure a lot of you hate the waiting times during our long ps4 gaming sessions. I’m pretty sure we waisted a ton of hours just waiting for things to load. But it’s not like that for the PS5!!!! here are a few games I tested out that loaded so fast and one that really surprised me the most and it’s not even a PS5 game. Skyrim! Let me talk about this one for a second. This game is so fast I was a bit shocked. I downloaded it and soon after I opened the app and woah! it literally got me right into the main menu before I could even blink my eyes. and it took about 10 or less seconds to jump right into the game. That is very impressive! Spider-Man remaster edition barely noticed the loading screens that is how fast it is that I can’t remember how fast I jumped into the game and that is a good thing that I don’t remember because we all know how frustrating it is to want to game right away but the system we owned before the PlayStation 5 never let us have fun right away haha.Dualsense Controller:Ok guys I really mean it about us being in the future. We are in the future!!! this controller is. But heavy but it feels so good in my hands! It feels so much better than the ps4 controller. But enough about how good it feels in my hands haha. I love the haptic feedback i was playing Astro playroom and also I put on the pulse 3D audio headphones on and I was mind blown! it was the most amazing thing I’ve ever held in my hands this is something I never knew I needed but now I’m hooked and I don’t wanna go back to a plain “vibration” haha. I felt like I was in a spaceship playing with the controller and using the dual sense at the same time! I can sit here and talk about this controller but ima let you go try it out. Go to Best Buy or GameStop or where ever they have a demo for you to play with and see for yourselves it is the future guys it really is and I can only imagine what virtual reality will be like on the next PSVR.Is The PlayStation 5 Loud: That is a great question!Here’s a simple answer to that. NO!this system is super quiet. As I’ve mentioned before, this system is so quiet I can finally game all night if I wanted to not waking up and getting complaints from my family. when I owned the PlayStation 4 I hated how loud that it was yes it sounded like a jet was going off! and it was the most frustrating thing about owning the PS4. Sony really did an amazing job with the the PlayStation 5. No more do you have to worry about your console heating up on you and turning off on you and sounding like it’s going to break haha.I’ll edit more at another time once I’ve used the PS5 more."

2665,Shaun m Dolan,2020,5,Demon’s Souls at 60fps.  All I need
2666,Alegna,2020,1,Retails bots. I hope you get stuck with a giant paperweight.
2667,Kisha Watson,2020,4,Asked to be notified as soon as consoles are available to purchase. So far 2 days past launch date and still nothing. I hope this wait doesn't go on too long.
2668,Jack,2020,1,The 1 star is for amazon not ps5. They helped scalper bots out with the way they handled the pre orders. Amazon has been acting scummy. Faith full prime members who invest their just get dumped on. Sincerely fuck you amazon.
2669,Bagelz,2020,5,"Copy your Saved Game and Application Data over from PS4 to USB before it arrives or you will have to reconnect your PS4. This process took almost 30-45min because of how slow it was from the PS4. I could download a 30GB game faster than that. I've only had it for about 3 days now. So I will give my impression, rather than a full review as the condition of the product has not been tested for a sufficient length of time.First impressions:- It's big- Different look that I'm OK with but not crazy over.- The controller is the star of the show honestly. The increased grip size is very nice and new rumble haptic feedback upgrades are worthy of the Next Gen title.- 60FPS is the new Standard, If a game doesn't come out with a 60FPS mode AT least, I won't buy it.- 4k 60FPS is Excellent and the picture quality A1.- The Console is quite even with a CD inside. Unlike the wannabe Aircraft PS4Cons: Very Minor but noticeable during initial set up- The Stand, used when the PS5 is placed horizontally, easily pops off the frame when I try to move the system briefly or plug-in a USB to the font. Unlike the ps4 were I could just do those actions with one hand. I find the need to hold the PS5 down while I plug and unplug a USB. if I picked it up, the stand would dangle off occasionally.You honestly only notice it when doing larger movements. So after it's set up, you won't encounter that issue at all."
2670,Delio,2020,5,Truly next gen. Transferring your data from the PS4 to the PS5 was simple and easy especially when you use a LAN Cable. The graphics are amazing and the the feel of the control feel next level. Truly good product and Sony can only improve on this.
2671,Musa,2020,5,Shout out to the guy who left a review even though he didn't get one. Got mine with 2 day shipping and I'm very satisfied.
2672,Nero Angelo,2020,5,Love it.
2673,Muu hamad,2020,5,Awesome gaming
2674,mark,2020,5,I want a ps5 plz add more
2675,Paul B.,2020,5,PS5 is AMAZING!! The haptic feedback of the controller is insane! Feels as though you are pulling a literal trigger in FPS games. The wait and lack of sleep to get one was absolutely worth it. Major plus to buying one is that you can play all your PS4 games on it and it’ll boost their performance.**Don’t understand people giving the system 1 star only because they didn’t get one? Doesn’t make much sense. Should rate the retailer not the system.
2676,Greg,2020,5,I think ps5 look great i cant wait play on it with 2 new game for ps5
2677,paul,2020,1,Got it like this. Someone tampered with it??
2678,Ryan Clarke,2020,5,Its beautiful T.T so glad we got this. The graphics are incredible even on our projetor with the light on. It came super fast as well it did not disappoint.
2679,Elias Martinez,2020,5,Is a really nice system to own. I have a high end pc and don't mine owning a PS5 as I have it in the living room to play with.
2680,Manny,2020,1,Xbox is better
2681,Amazon Customer,2020,1,I can’t get one 😞 really really sucks . Why not be open with times . Scalpers are gonna camp your website anyway atleast a few of us will have a shot with times announced 😞 nobody wants to refresh your page 24 hours a day when we have lives to live . I commend Walmart even though it’s almost impossible to get one atleast there was a chance !
2682,Colby Bean,2020,1,load of bs if you ask me
2683,garret wood,2020,5,"Fantastic system, a beautiful chunky boy that is every bit worth the $399-499 it costs. Highly recommend playing Astro's Playroom to get a feel for the controller. The haptic feedback isn't just a gimmick, it's honestly fantastic, and if the developers of games take it seriously it can dramatically change the way games are played. Miles Morales is a treat, and is the game I'd recommend most for players to really see the beauty of the system at its finest. Whether you prefer the gorgeous visuals of full 4k fidelity with ray tracing, making New York City shine like never before, or the silky smooth 4k60 of performance mode which feels so good, you'll be thrilled with either choice. Absolutely worth it, don't regret at all."
2684,Justin,2020,1,All sold. All being sold now for way overprice. This has been consistently happening for every major tech release. Hopefully this encourages people not to buy into the the scheme big tech has created. They preach they want to help us and the environment. Then why is everything outdated and quickly needs replacing. Thanks big business and to the scalpers that will help us quit our addiction to new shiny things
2685,Kenneth E. Evans,2020,5,Just amazing — even the free game Astro’s Playroom will make you feel like you’ve reached the next generation of gaming. I can’t wait for all of the incredible stuff to come.
2686,Jared Fite,2020,5,"4K + HDR + 60FPS = A next gen package at an affordable cost. The dual sense controller is fantastic and feels like a leap forward in terms of immersion through the haptics and adaptive triggers. Astrobot is a great packaged in game that really demonstrates a lot of the new features that make PS5 such a great system. If you can get your hands on a system, it is well worth the investment."
2687,Hendo,2020,5,"In a word, absolutely. I got into the PS4 game later into the console’s lifespan even though I never even touched most of the first-party lineup of titles. This time around, there’s all of the under the hood improvements to enjoy right now, as well as a pretty highly-anticipated roster of games due out in 2021. If you’ve got plenty of mileage out of your PS4, or don’t own one at all, the PS5 brings so much to the table and makes a great first impression.Better graphics, responsiveness, an enhanced controller experience, and all of the other improvements might not be massive in their own right. But together they form a clear picture of what the next-generation console experience will look like. And I have to say, I’m impressed."
2688,Jacqueline Parlanti,2020,1,"Sony is trash.  Y’all allowing bots to pick pocket your fan base and do nothing about it.  Maybe your new slogan should be “Ps5, limited by poor distribution”"
2689,Alexander Gonzalez,2020,5,"I gotta say I got lucky when I opened the Amazon App on Sep 16 and I was able to Pre-Order the console, I wasn’t even sure it would arrive on time because I never received any updates until the last 3 days, but as promised by an Amazon Customer Service Representative the console arrived on release day.As for the console, what is there to say, XBox lost this battle even before release, I own both consoles and I can say that the PS5 lives up and exceeded every expectations I had."
2690,CommonConsumer,2020,5,"This product is not a gimmick let’s establish that baseline. The graphics are phenomenal, very comparable to PC. I’m excited to see where Sony and game developers take this."
2691,Rax,2020,1,with small ssd
2692,Nathan K,2020,5,"It's amazing, and I wish everyone else good fortune and luck on their escapades of acquiring a PS5!"
2693,Arron Mc Neill,2020,1,"Don't even try to buy a PS5 it is just a Sony scam to get more money. This page has never had stuff for sale, Not even the Playstation web site."
2694,luis,2020,5,Best console ever
2695,ErinE,2020,1,"PS5 has faulty HDMI. Been trying to contact support and when you do there is no ""queue"" due to the amounts of issues that Sony has going on right now."
2696,Brian B.,2020,1,Shame on you America.
2697,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"Product arrived on Launch day, zero dents on packaging, playing Miles and Demon's Souls on it. Console is fairly large and bulky, but looks real sleek. Controller feels sturdy and the Feedback features on it feel great while playing, all this while enhancing older PS4 titles and much more to come. Thanks Amazon and Sony!"
2698,Leonard Buxton,2020,5,Shipped on time and made my week. Thanks Amazon
2699,Adrian Z.,2020,2,Can't even buy one. Smh...
2700,Ann Marie Mostek ,2020,1,You really think you can get away with selling this for thosands if dollars more then it is worth?! What the heck!!!
2701,JG,2020,1,"I understand that so many people are excited to get their hands on one of these. But when retailers allow you to purchase 20 at a time, there is something wrong there. No capcha during launch day, buggy servers (like no one was expecting this console to be popular, based on a fact as many preorders got sold in a first DAY to 12 WEEKS of PS4 during launch).I am reconsidering my choices, and might rather build PC later on. Who in their right mind pay $1500 for one of these?!"
2702,Joshua Powers,2020,5,This next gen console puts its competitor to shame. Beautiful. Fast. Best game lineup. If you can get your hands on one you should!
2703,Amazon Customer,2020,1,"After waiting a whole month.. I have received a defective item. The PS5 constantly turns off and on outta nowhere. I'm also getting constant Glitch GPU patterns. I already contacted Amazon, they said they don’t have any left, I will have to wait for restock and there’s no date for when will be available again. It’s very frustrating knowing now I’m $550 less, no ps5, no option to get a new one from Amazon."
2704,Gavin,2020,5,Great Consol with great game and It looks really great and it runs really great it’s a lot better than the PS4 And thank God Amazon has a feature I would’ve got it and it’s got a gaming Exclusive such as Spiderman and god of war you can’t go wrong getting the consul
2705,Nash,2020,5,"Best 2,500 dollars ever spent, now I can join the mockers to attack those who don't have a PS5 yet."
2706,baxter,2020,5,Greatest Thing Ever.
2707,joseph,2020,1,Not worth the time it takes to try and find one that's not at scalper price. This is one of the worst products I have had to deal with as far as availability goes. They could have done any number of things to prevent scalpers from taking it from people that want a console to actually play.
2708,James Thomas,2020,1,"Junk. Constant overheats, takes forever to load. Save your money and get the version 2 once they can get quality components again."
2709,Chris O,2020,1,"The release is so unorganized, playstations are getting robbed by scalpers and being left no choice but to pay 1000 plus. At this point, no one can get a ps5. Terrible way to handle this for the loyal PlayStation fans."
2710,Anthony,2020,5,"Works perfectly! I've been playing Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Demon Souls, and Black Ops Cold War. Nice to be playing game at 60fps. The adaptive triggers on the Dualsense is amazing as it goes with the game you are playing. Example: in Call of Duty the trigger will change resistance on what weapon you are wielding. Playstation did an extraordinary job as usual."
2711,Resell Tech,2020,5,"I bought the launch PS4 back in 2013 and it worked great until the last few months, as if it knew i was about to get the next gen PS5. Here is a quick breakdown of what I like and dislike about this console:LIKE- Fantastic new controller- Streamlined UI puts games first- Great exclusive game lineup- Included Astro's Playroom game is fantasticDON'T LIKE- The bold design is borderline impractical for small spaces- Syncing up cloud saves can be a pain- I don't love the clunky-feeling plastic standLOOKS:The PS5 is far and away the most flamboyant-looking console I’ve ever owned. It is obviously not the first white console but its sheer size and shape make it stand out in a room. Even though i am a little skeptical how easily dust and scratches will accumulate on the cheap looking plastic.Looking at the PS5 from the front, you will find access to the ultra Blu-ray optical drive, a high speed USB type-C port, as well as the power button and eject button. These buttons are adjacent to each other but the eject button is noticeably smaller so, if you’re anything like me, there’s now hope of not spending an entire generation trying to remember which button is which. On the back there’s the figure-8 power connection, an HDMI 2.1 out, two super-speed USB Type-A ports, and an Ethernet port. Unlike the PS4, the PS5 does not feature an optical audio out. The stand is necessary because the misshapen nature of the plates means the PS5 can’t sit flat on its side properly without it. It has a pair of small hooks, which loosely clutch the back of the PS5, and a rotating base. Sitting flat, the console is simply perched on the stand without any additional fixtures. The base can flap around and slip left, right, or even off entirely, but that’s something unlikely to frustrate unless you’re regularly moving your console from place to place. Positioned vertically, a single screw is required to affix the stand to the console to prevent it from falling out of it. The slotted, “cheese head” screw comes stored in the stand itself and is easy to install; if you don’t have a flat screwdriver, a knife or even your thumbnail will suffice.USER INTERFACE:The other key point of difference are dubbed Cards, which are also presented on screen when you hit the PlayStation button. Some of these are just fluff, like links to newly-published articles about games you’re following on PlayStation and recent screenshots, though the Activity Cards seem to have the potential to be a little more useful. There’s information about how much longer it’s estimated you’ll need to complete a certain level or task, or the ability to immediately view pre-made game hints without having to reach for your phone. For example, it was revealed earlier this week the PS5 remake of Demon’s Souls will feature over 180 help videos that players can opt to watch if they get stuck. The ultimate value of the Activity Cards is hard to gauge at the genesis of the PS5, though; hopefully developers will embrace them as useful ways to communicate to players while in-game and not turn them into lists of additional chores.The PS5’s UI does make a few changes of note for those who liked to Trophy hunt, as well as for those who like to customise their setup. On the former, Trophies are now easily accessible to view on a per-game basis from each game’s individual splash page on the dashboard, while Trophy info can also be included in the new Activity Card view. And on the latter, the PS5 doesn’t have overall themes you can select, so your dynamic themes won’t carry over. However, each PS5 game seems to come with its own mini-theme of sorts; when selecting a next-gen game on the dashboard, each game features a big piece of art alongside some music from that specific game. It may not overhaul the UI buttons like a dynamic theme could, but it’s nice to let each game in your library offer a showcase for itself.DOUBLE THE SPEED OF AN XBOX SERIES X:There’s other interesting stuff sprinkled throughout the PS5’s UI too, though, from global settings to automatically configure difficulty, subtitle preferences, and even invert the Y-axis by default – like the Xbox 360 used to do (take note, Microsoft) – to the ability to watch a friend play a game picture-in-picture while chatting to them as you play something else entirely. I’m not a particularly proficient multitasker so I can’t say I’m very interested in the latter, but the idea of not having to spend the opening moments of virtually every game inverting the Y-axis warms my old-school, upside-down heart.One of this generation’s most important upgrades is the switch from traditional hard drives to solid-state storage drives, dramatically improving loading times across the board and potentially enabling games to load in new objects effectively on the fly. The PS5’s SSD can read 5.5GB in just one second (which is, on paper, twice as fast as the Series X). In practical terms, it means I could go from powering up from a complete shutdown to perched on top of whatever Manhattan building I last left Miles Morales on in a mere 45 seconds. That still leaves time to tap your toe, but once I was in a game, the time it takes to go from selecting a save to load to actually swinging through Spider-Man: Miles Morales’ open world is basically a blink. It takes me longer to enter my passcode that it does to load a save. After generations of watching progress bars inching across a screen it’s pretty stunning stuff.Unfortunately, one of the PS5’s key strengths – its lightning-quick SSD – is also one of its weaknesses. It may say 825GB on the box but that translates to just 667GB of usable space, which is significantly smaller than the Xbox Series X’s 802GB of usable space. That’s room for maybe a dozen games, and even fewer if they’re anything like current-generation behemoths like The Last of Us Part II (78GB) or Grand Theft Auto V (94GB). As I mentioned, you can carry on using any external hard drive you may have already been using in your PS4 and continue to play PS4 games off of it, but PS5 games can only be played when installed on the SSD. And while you can open up the top lid of the console to install an additional SSD for more internal space, there are currently no Sony-approved drives on the market.VerdictWith a launch line-up dominated by games that are also available on PS4, and on the back of a generation already punctuated with incrementally more powerful hardware revisions like the PS4 Pro, the PS5 doesn’t quite land as a knockout punch yet – but it’s definitely got the power and speed to be a real contender (although the jury’s out on the stamina of that tiny 667GB SSD). However, while the PS5’s well-considered UI and blisteringly-quick loading times for PS5 games make it a pleasure to use, it’s the DualSense controller that’s proven to be the surprise haymaker I never saw coming; it truly leaves other controllers feeling primitive in comparison."
2712,Chivas Kimber,2020,5,This thing is incredible! Its like night and day from my ps4 and I'm so happy to have it! I hope everyone that didn't get one gets it fast because it's a game changer!
2713,Didi Gray,2020,1,Thanks for nothing..
2714,rosalba c maldonado,2020,5,This console is very good and looks awesome
2715,Brenda,2020,5,Awesome gaming machine!
2716,André,2020,5,"So let me start by saying that I fully acknowledge why so many people are upset. I have friends that have been trying to gain access to the pre-order for weeks and now just the regular release with no luck. Poorly communicated release dates/times, bad website experiences, server issues — pretty terrible. I got very lucky and was able to snag one before they sold out — I feel incredibly privileged and would be quite upset if I was on the other side of the fence.All of that being said, I now have the console all set up with my current games and have had a day to experience some of the new features. Loading time is down significantly from PS4, new UI is pretty intuitive(feels more practical and less intrusive when in game), controller is a huge step up in terms of experience — I would say the controller is the clear differentiator between the PS5 vs. PS4. Adaptive triggers feel great and are a super fascinating hardware feature for this console. Exiting to see how game devs will use this hardware.The unit itself is not very attractive in my opinion. It's a bit of an eyesore compared to the PS4, but that's just my preference. Significantly bigger than the PS4, so make sure you have room to store it.Overall very happy with the purchase and I'm excited to try some games other than Astro Bot that utilize the PS5's new features."
2717,Wesley,2020,5,Important......Keep your mouth shut if you want it more people who know the faster and more crashes happen I would love my cart to go smoothly as many more will find out whenThis product I have reviewed from a friend it so quiet that you have to have your ear to it thermal paste is done well and speeds are awesome no lag with larger tv to too it off you can connect a ps4 formated hard drive to it however all ps5 games must be stored in the internal hardrive.
2718,Anthony “DarkGemineye” Johnson,2020,5,So far the PS5 is everything I wanted it to be and more. The only drawback is the amount of storage you get on day one which can fill up pretty quickly. Right now I’m watching my daughter play Astro’s Playroom but I’m going to dive into some other games real soon.
2719,Joe,2020,1,I’m so sick of these companies purposefully limiting supply when launching new products to purposefully try and manufacture additional hype. It’s maddening. Sony knee this thing would sell out in seconds. Now everyone has to sit around and wait for god knows how long to try and buy one of these things. It’s stupid. Have enough supply for everyone to be able to buy one who wants one.
2720,dans,2020,5,"Got on at exactly the right time, wasn't even trying.  This will be the best Christmas ever for my son."
2721,Taf,2020,1,Can't get one. What's the point of all this?
2722,tristan,2020,5,"Controller is truly next gen, not much to say. Big upgrade over my ps4 slim and competitive with my PC performance too (for now)"
2723,Kobraki,2020,1,"What a joke, once again Sony is a complete failure. Time to switch permanently to Microsoft."
2724,Jose Garcia,2020,1,"Didn’t even get to make a purchase because of Amazon. I’m sure it’s a great console, but Amazon can go suck themselves."
2725,Eric Smith,2020,1,Why even release a console with limited availability to let all the scammers with bots buy them up for resale.
2726,Amazon Customer,2020,5,"PS5 is worth the wait. I got mine through Sony Playstation Store via pre order invite. It arrived on launch day.I've played Dirt 5 and Call of Duty: Cold War so far. I was able to get both running at 120 frames per second at 1080p. My TV is a Samsung RU8000 and doesn't have HDMI 2.1. It can't render 4k at 120 frames. If your goal is high frames and 4k you will need a TV with HDMI 2.1 and 8k cables. LG CX seems to be the favorite.The Haptic Feedback is game changing. You have to feel it for yourself. The triggers provide much resistance at times like in Dirt 5 they try to mimic a gas pedal. It can wear out your finger if you play too long. For CoD they have it mimicking a trigger pull and it vibrates with the recoil which feels awesome but could put you at a disadvantage to those who aren't using Haptic Feedback. I don't care though. I love the feel. If you're on the fence between XBOX Series X or PS5 the Haptic Feedback definitely tips the scales towards PS5. You're not going to get that anywhere else, at least not any time soon."
2727,Rudy,2020,1,"Who would pay almost $1,300 for a $500 console?"
2728,Almeida,2020,5,The console was manufactured for speed and reliability. The dualsense controller is revolutionary piece of tech to hold and the haptics are truly an immersive experience. Play Has No Limits.
2729,moghraby,2020,1,700 dollars more . RIDICULOUS
2730,Azamat,2020,1,"Just buy WHY???  This is taking a advantage of people and I would never pay that much money for gaming console, I rather buy computer for this amount of money. If I could give zero star I would"

2732,Bioptic,2020,5,"Not much to say, this is truly a next gen!!"
2733,Brenton,2020,1,Don’t have one yet and at this rate probably won’t be able to get one. Please don’t buy the system from some scalper who raised the prices.
2734,Edwin,2020,4,me enviaron la version digital yo pedi la version de cd😂. la consola es excellente todo ahora es mas rapido y los juegos se ven excellente  dependiendo que televisor tengas veras todo lo que esta consola puede ofrecer por el momento mi televisor se ve bien pero mi tv no le saca el potencial al play full recomiendo esperen un poco si tienen un tv 4k de varios años atras muchos de los televisores modernos no tiene inplemantado todo lo que nesesitas para tu consola al menos compres un tv 1000 dolares o mas 😅.
2735,Marty,2020,1,I mean it’s a scalped console why else would I rate it 1 star
2736,chi,2020,1,This is a scalper...just wait for sony to release more to a big name company. Don't waste your money on this guy
2737,Andy,2020,1,"This launch release is plagued like 2020 itself.Only scalpers, bots, and select few were able to get their hands on this."
2738,mustafa quraishi,2020,4,"The next-gen outperforms 99.99% of same-priced PCs but that's too be expected. It seems like a solid benchmark for the next few years but it will be interesting to see how it holds up towards the end of its lifespan. I also wish they would add in support for Discord or some way to talk to players on PC. I know they updated the app so you can talk from your phone but even that isn't good.Although I was lucky enough to get one, I feel the launch was handled horribly as I found much of the stock in the hands of single persons."
2739,ghulam hussain,2020,5,Ok
2740,Narek,2020,1,"Really do not understand why they made so little most people want it and can not get it do they not want to sell more, I just do not understand why they are doing this it’s ridiculous."

2743,Jasmine Jones,2020,5,It really is Next Gen the fan is much better than the PS4 the controller is absolutely great it really feels like next gen absolutely would recommend.
2744,Evelyn,2020,5,Guys calm down!!! Please don’t get over then 5 TS5 worry about the other people!! Lol I’m here looking like a 🤡 :(  waiting for a available TS5!!!!
2745,Darylann,2020,5,Arrived safely! This system is HUGE and my son is a very happy camper!
2746,Kenny,2020,5,"Great console, os is snappy, downloads fast and controller is great! Good next Gen games, Demon Souls is a sight to see."
2747,Patrick Fagan,2020,5,If you are looking for a next gen experience PS5 is the way to go. The haptic feedback from the controller is game changing and the sad is blazing fast. just be patient and DONT BUY FROM SCALPERS
2748,hoang hien khuu,2020,5,"If you are like me and transferring from an Xbox one to a ps5, there will be a lot to unload and unpack. The UI at first was hard to go through as it was very different from the xbox one UI. After about 30 minutes though, it became very simple and easy to navigate throughout the home screen. The console is also very big but beautiful so it does even out the bad. The controller feels amazing in your hands and really is the future of gaming. If you have the money and are thinking about getting this console, I say absolutely get this as it is very addicting and worth the money 100%"
2749,655321Amazon Customer655321,2020,1,"Sadly, my PS5 is faulty.  It won’t play any PS5 games for longe than 5 minutes without crashing.  Sony has been completely unhelpful in trying to fix this issue.  I now own a $500 piece of modern art that belongs in a garbage bin.  Do not buy this until Sony addresses the myriad of bugs and learns how to treat its customers with a modicum of respect."
2750,dan,2020,5,Sold my ps4 pro to offset the cost. This monster is backwards compatible!!!! Get you one when you have the chance to!

2752,Joshua&Kayla,2020,5,"The PS5 is finally here and it’s ... totally worth it. I recieved the disc version.I’ll start off by saying while there’s plenty of space you’ll want to invest in or use a external HD to hold your previous library.You can transfer between systems save date ,games, etc via a lan cable. It’s painfully easy.Using the new PlayStation app to sign in is a cinch.I’ll update more as time goes on but the system is flawless."
2753,Richard C.,2020,5,"Super excited about the Playstation 5! The high speed SSD downloads games at a speed never before seen on console! Frame rates are fantastic, resolution is awesome and I’m loving it so far! Must buy as the game library expands! Amazon did an amazing job getting it to me on release day."
2754,Evan Frasier,2020,5,Came safely packaged arrived very fast!Easy setup.
2755,Vichhean Chhin,2020,5,This console is incredible! Truly next gen
2756,Fantasyxo ,2020,5,✊🏾🙏🏾✨✨
2757,Aravind,2020,5,"Goods:- The dual sense controller is the biggest highlight of the new console. The adaptive triggers and the newly reworked haptic feedback is a big game changer. Can't wait for the next gen games that exploit the capabilities.- LOAD TIMES!! just blazes through right into the game, no more progress bars. YAY!- Frame rates for existing ps4 are perceivably improved;- Ability to switch between fidelity and performance modes in games like MilesMorales are a welcome update.Bads:- SIZE: its hugggggeeee!!! and kinda ugly too; doesn't fit into the existing media cabinets; Not a good feel when are forced to hide your new toy behind the TV.- New dual sense controller being bigger takes a bit of time getting used to. Felt a bit of soreness in hand after about 4 hrs of gameplay.- There are no 4K 120 FPS games at launch. Don't rush to upgrade ur TV for HDMI 2.1 as yet."
2758,Amazon Customer,2020,5,Love my PS5! The interface is beautiful and seamless - a big step up from previous Playstation's in speed and quality. The graphics on a 4K - 120 Hz TV are unreal. Extremely satisfied with this purchase.
2759,Jay,2020,5,"Wow. From the moment you open the box and see the console, you feel like you are in the future. Playstation really embraced next gen, not just in graphics and fps, but in the experience. The 3D audio is crisp and loud, the controller is always moving, emulating every sensation occurring in the games, it truly takes immersion to the next level."
2760,Alexandra Oliveros,2020,1,Horrible did not work properly
2761,Michael P. Oconnor,2020,4,"I got the PS5 yesterday, it is a great system, extremely fast, but it does have some issues, I do not like the new trophy interface I do not like, they took the card interface way to far there, the trophy as a list is still ok, you don't need every thing to be a ""card"" in the interface.Another issue, is they still don't have Bluetooth audio support for Bluetooth headsets need to use a USB to Bluetooth adapter.The only other issue is the sizeNow that I got the 3 bad things out of the way on to the good.But the load times are hyper fast, they are still there, but not as bad as they were on my PS4 Pro (even with a SATA SSD)  They still exist but it not as long as it was.The controller is comfortable.The graphics look better,Whisper quite even when deep in an action game.Setup and transfer of games/saves was very easy (you can use the PS app to sign into the console for the first time)I am looking forward to all the new exclusives that are to come out next year (especially The next Horizon Zero Dawn)I would love to give it 5 stars, but I really think the 3 issues, do pull half a star off, but I can not give 4.5 so I am forced to give it only 4, if they fix those 2 of those 3 issues I will update this and up it to 5."
2762,Pat,2020,1,"Garbage, getting a pc and joining the master race."
2763,Chad L.,2020,3,Its so big omg ha don't like they going Xbox style at all but still an amazing machine! Also don't like you have to put it sideways go get circulation to not over heat and miss out on all the cool changing colors etc. Also hard to put the disks in. Also does not play 3d movies and won't even let you stream 3d either huge downfall for me there for that price come on now!
2764,Calvin,2020,5,"First, I'd like to express how great a job Amazon did with my pre-order. I was a little hesitant to do a pre-order from an online store at first but I ran out of options as Best Buy had technical issues and Target sold out immediately. The Amazon site had no hiccups or crashes. I put the PS5 in cart and checked out with no issues. I got confirmation that my order was received and it was done. I saw many people on social media complaining about how they couldn't get their orders in from other stores but I had no issues. Fast forward to a week before launch day, my order status was still show no estimated delivery yet and I began to worry that I'd have delays. I had heard that Amazon sent emails to a few customers stating that they might get their orders on launch day so I was worried I'd be one of those since my order status hadn't changed. Then finally the day before launch day I get an email saying my order was shipped! The morning of launch day, I went to track my order and not only did it give me an estimated delivery time,  but it had a live tracker of where my package was on a map and how many stops the driver had before delivery mine. I had never seen or heard of such an informative tracking system until now. And there I was hanging out of my blinds, phone in hand like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to take delivery of my PS5! Of course the package came in secure and undamaged. I had to shout out Amazon for what turned out to be the best online shopping, and pre-order, experience I had ever gone through!The PS5 so far has blown my mind! Yes, the graphics and game performance are much improved over last gen, but the UI is very sleek and lightning fast! Everything moves so fast, downloads happens almost instantaneously, and there are no lags in navigating the UI. Performance may be very comparable to the xBox Series X, but the Dual Sense controller is what sets the 2 apart. Very pleased with Sony for this piece of tech. It is very Nintendo-esque.Overall, very happy with the entire transaction and product. Amazon, you did it again!"
2765,nojtek,2020,5,"Received my console yesterday from Amazon pre-order, which despite getting e-mails after the purchase stating it may not arrive release date, to my surprised did. I realize that won't be the case for everyone, but it was a pleasant surprise.The console itself is a giant amongst consoles, as seen in any video about the console. The disc drive, confusingly to me, is on the bottom part of the console under the lip. Initially I set it up upside down and got an error when I put the disc in upside down. So far mine hasn't put off too many loud noises. At one point the disc drive sounded a little loud, but was not too bad. Initially after the setup, going through the menus right after, there did seem to be some kind of lag from something installing in the background that gave me the impression that it was locked up. I did end up rebooting it and the sluggishness continued, but when I came back later, about 10 minutes it was acting normal.The controller is awesome. I do miss the size and feel of the PS4 controller but some of the things that developers will be able to implement should be exciting, should they choose to take full advantage of the technology. The best way to get an idea of its capabilities is Astros Playroom which comes preloaded. It gives you an idea of the possibilities for the tech. I had read up on the Dualsense and was not too surprised by that, but what did surprise me was the haptic triggers. The pressure needed to press the triggers can change depending on the game setting. During the demo it almost felt as if something was keeping it from being pressed and then after went back to normal. This was crazy to me as it was my first experience with these kind of triggers. The controller also comes USB-C which is refreshing as well as the standard built in battery.The installation is just like the previous generations. Two prong power cable and HDMI. I've read that if you have a new (2019-2020) TV with HDMI 2.1 to make sure and use the cable supplied or a 2.1 HDMI cable. Some reports are coming in of black screens when powering up the console. I don't have a newer TV like this so my old cable worked just fine with no issues. Again, it seems to only be if your TV supports HDMI 2.1.I bought my console with Demon Souls and Assassins Creed Valhalla. Demon Souls is a very good looking game and Valhalla looks about like the current gen games. Judging on these games alone, it doesn't feel completely next gen, but that's to be expected during the early life of the console. For me the controller is what actually feels net generation. These feels just like the PS4 at launch, sort of a mid generation console until developers really start taking advantage of the hardware.Overall for the price and what I received, I give it 5 starts. It helps that the hard drive and disc drive on my launch PS4 are going out right as this is coming out. Also with the backwards compatibility with PS4 games makes it worth it to me."
2766,Shef,2020,5,"I got my PS5 on launch day admittedly due to great luck. It’s massive. About twice as heavy and large as the PS4 slim. I actually like the curve appeal so to speak. It can stand upright without a stand but requires a plastic attachment to sit on its side.Once turned on it was really easy to set up. The software guides you through everything and makes it easy to transfer your saves from PS4 if it’s also connected to your local network. The system was up and running in about fifteen minutes. It also was ready to play Assassins Creed Valhalla in about five minutes. I also downloaded God of War and Last of Us part 2 and both were ready to play in under ten minutes.The controller is my favorite part of the new system. It’s extremely comfortable to hold and is a logical evolution from the previous DualShock from PS4.Once I fired up ACV, the loading times were extremely fast and there were no issues loading textures. When starting a game from the hone screen for the first time, it takes about 30 seconds. From rest mode it’s even faster, maybe 10. If you die in game, or fast travel, the loading times are only a few seconds.Finally to turn the console off, you have to hit the PS button on the controller once to open a menu and the power button is all the way to the right. I preferred the old way better, but it’s easily fixed with a software update.Good luck getting your PS5! I don’t think you need one urgently given the lack of games, but I’m excited to play ACV and Cyberpunk on this new system."
2767,Mike,2020,1,"Epic articifial demand created by Sony, as usual. Sony exec: ""okay, 40,000,000 people want the console, so let's produce 10,000 in the first run."""
2768,Karlos,2020,5,I ordered the console. The best console ever in history. Please buy it.
2769,Michael Percy,2020,5,I was fortunate to be one of the first to get a PS5 and I must say it is a worth while purchase.Key highlights:Loading time is super fastRay tracing is pretty as anythingThe controller is next level with the feedback and triggers 🤤I am excited for down the road releases like FF16 and Horizon 2. I would though say wait till the SSD add on update comes for extra storage as that is the systems only weak point.Overall though very pleased.
2770,Timothy Morsch,2020,5,Love the new playstation 5. I can download my old download games and still play them . Thank you so much

2773,tedleefontain,2020,5,"Do you really need to read this? But I'll still say it. This is AMAZING, I have owned every console available. This is the biggest leap in ""next gen"" I've experienced. The jump from ps3 to ps4 was whatever, same with xbox 360 to xbox one. This... THIS, the controller is the most amazing thing. Spend a good amount of time playing astros playroom, it will show you how amazing the peice of tech your holding is. The controller is a huge step, I don't think xbox even attempted this. Not to mention the day tracing. A huge jump in graphics and realism. I was playing (watching) mile morales, there was a few times I had to remind myself it was a video game. Over all of the years, I could always tell it was a game, but it's getting to the point its a challenge now. Hands down my most favorite tech buy in the last 5 years, if not ever. If you can get it, don't hesitate, you won't regret it."
2774,Joe,2020,5,"I love it... I love it so much. Truly a next-gen experience. Everything about it is perfect. The console, the controller, the games, it’s just... perfect."
2775,randy the fool,2020,1,"PlayStation and Microsoft have once again invented a biting war, it goes back many years.people should just quit buying their garbage. It’s every time they come with something new in electronic. It’s a rush, and trying to get one is crazy. We are fools, we’re like rats, and places like Amazon is killing other stores, and don’t pay taxes. You wouldn’t believe the things I buy on Amazon. It time to kill the beast."
2776,Gökhan,2020,1,"Although the expectation is known, I do not understand why so few of them are produced and distributed. You may have built a good device, but your sales policy is absolutely awful. x box is the leader in this"
2777,Geoff,2020,5,"[Initial Thoughts—Please stay tuned as I plan to add to this as I go]Opening the Box:Unboxing the PS5 reminded me of my first experience with Apple products years and years ago.  And if you are not an Apple fan, you might not realize, how, back in the dark ages, tech was haphazardly packaged or that everyone else largely does it the “Apple way” nowadays.  Needless to say, my experience was refined, not clunky, with the layout making sense, and very little wasted space.The Beast inside:The PS5 itself, is, well, massive.  It dwarfs the PS4 Pro, and hell, even the new options from Microsoft.  The styling of this hunk of plastic and metal is equally in your face.  There is no two ways about it, some will love it, others will hate it and pray for a refined “slim version” to come sooner than later.  I am more the former than the latter as I enjoy something a bit futuristic when it comes to my console experience.  In other words, I like that it looks like a vase, even if it has become the ridicule of many who make many phallic jokes about it.  That said, the disc drive version, which I have is a bit awkward at the base as it is a bit more “girthy” (Yeah, I know, I know.) than the digital edition.Setup:Setup experience is, well, exceptional.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been gaming a long a** time.  My first console was an Atari 2600 and man, oh man, have we come a long way from that thing.  It is, and I will borrow the old catch phrase from Apple-land, “it just works”.  Transferring of games and save information over your router in between your two consoles is rather seamless but depending on how much you are shipping from your PS4 to your PS5, it might take a bit.  I had heard that there was a way to directly connect the two, however, I did not do so.*That said, COD: MW (2019) gave me a bit of trouble because of the sheer size, which led me to popping in the install disc to help speed it along.Noise level of the PS5:The PS5 is rather quiet, the loudest part, and it really is not that loud, per se, is the disc drive.  And, if you owned a PS4 or PS4 Pro, you would appreciate the fact that the 4k blu ray drive in this does not sound like you are opening and closing a 55’ Chevy Truck door.  It loads quietly, largely runs quietly, and ejects, quietly.  But what about the fan?  You can hear the fan's ""whirring"" sound if you get up close to it.  Apparently, Sony has the ability to send out firmware updates that can change how the sound works.  For you tin foil hat wearing folks, be ware, BIG BROTHER is watching you....and your PS5 fan.The UI:The UI, as much as the DualSense, is pretty much the talk of the town, right?  But, it is a bit disorienting until you start to learn it.  That said, as for speed and ease of navigation, I give the overall feel of it, a solid 8/10.  Why not a perfect score, well, because nothing is perfect and I feel as if it almost a mix of the Switch’s UI and the PS4 and while I think it looks great, runs great, but I am not sure I fully love it, yet.  For instance, some functions, feel buried, but they are not really, it is just how you access them that has changed, which means, you and I have to change.  Do note, I am not saying this is for the better, I am saying this is how it is.Storage:The Elephant in the room.  Storage.  Storage is limited.  There is really no other way to say it.  For instance, after installing Fall Guys, COD: Modern Warfare (2019) and keeping Astro's Playroom installed, I had roughly 300gbs of space left.  Now, not everyone happens to like having a catalog of games on their drive, which is fine.  But many do.  And with Sony releasing a digital edition, one would think that they would, custom drive not withstanding, given a bit more.  Further, Sony does not have or has not yet released a list of drives that can populate the extra M.2 port that can take advantage of PS5s incredibly speedy architecture.  This problem is further compounded because currently, you cannot offload games onto a USB attached storage drive.The Controller:The DualSense, without any game play, feels nice and hefty.  Though, I will note the D-Pad feels a bit “squishy” to me.  When playing games with it, it feels good.  I have average hands, maybe a tad small (HEY!  They are mighty hands, you leave me be!) and I did not experience any discomfort.  In games where the DualSense is programed for, you will feel things differently as you play.  It really is a step forward in that regards.  In games, however, that are not setup for it, you essentially get the feel of rumble, all day, everyday.  However, I encourage you to play Astro's playroom or Spiderman MM to get a good feel of its potential.The Games:At launch, Sony has a slight advantage with games--but not with subscription service.  Whether they are all new, Demon's Souls, for instance, is another issue.  As for playing games, I tried a couple of ""older"" titles, ""Fall Guys""  and ""COD: Modern Warfare (2019)""--most notalby, Warzone.  Both displayed improved load times, especially for the latter title.  MW had a graphical and textural pack applied to it and while it helped some, I did not feel it made that much of a difference on the newer system as compared to when I played it on my old PS4 Pro.  Indeed, it looked a bit more washed out, but consider, I had switched over from ""Fall Guys"", which is a cornucopia of colors that vary the spectrum or simply, it is like playing a game inside a bag of Skittles.  You get my point.But where this thing shines, frankly, and everyone has told you this-- and they ain't lyin' brosephus and sistersephus-- is with games built for it.  On the PS5 the best examples of this are going to be ""Demon's Souls"" and ""Spiderman: Miles Morales"" and ""Astro's Playroom"".  As of this update, I have played all three and can say confidently you will not be disappointed."
2778,Frank,2020,4,It's been great so far except for the fact that it all of a sudden stopped working and my controller stopped working as well and I had to unplug it to make it shut off and then come back on and it worked fine for me after that but still was kinda scary that it happened hopefully it doesn't happen again
2779,Wayne,2020,5,This console is just amazing and crazy innovative

Super fast, and graphics look decent.-The console has a weird clicky noise, not sure if that is normal or a potential future problem.-Also the lack of resolution 1440p is really annoying. Once Sony adds support for that I'll change my review.Overall it's an okay console, nothing crazy."
2784,Angel,2020,5,Well worth it resold it for $950! Worth the wait
2785,Noel Helms,2020,5,Next Gen is truly here. This is by far one of the best purchases of tech I’ve ever made. Superb quality.
2786,Alex,2020,5,All i have to say is that it’s amazing 😆
2787,Matthew J. Prevost,2020,1,What a scam!
2788,ZVB73,2020,5,"The PS5 is massive. Just up front, make sure to clear some space, then clear some extra space on top of that.That being said, this console is exceptional. Experiencing true 4K with HDR and ray tracing is just unbelievable. Guys, next gen is here.Worth noting that VRR (variable refresh rate) is not currently supported despite it having been listed as a feature. Hope it comes in a patch soon.I also did experience a system crash already. (currently still day 1). The system does need a stability patch, but it's performing well given it is the first day.Would definitely recommend."
2789,chris,2020,5,"Super fast and a crisp image, its awesome. The console itself is pretty massive, which isnt an issue for me."
